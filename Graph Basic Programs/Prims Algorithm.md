### Prim's Algorithm

Prim's Algorithm is a popular method for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the edges that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight. Here's a detailed explanation of Prim's Algorithm along with its time and space complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(E log V)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(E + V)\)

### Prim's Algorithm Overview

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an arbitrary vertex as the initial vertex. This vertex is considered as part of the MST.
   - Initialize a set to keep track of vertices included in the MST.
   - Initialize a priority queue (or a min-heap) to store edges based on their weights.

2. **Growing the MST**:
   - While there are vertices not yet included in the MST:
     - Select the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
     - Add this edge to the MST.
     - Add the new vertex to the MST.
     - Update the priority queue with the edges connected to the new vertex, but only if the other end of the edge is not in the MST.

3. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm terminates when all vertices are included in the MST.

### Detailed Steps of Prim's Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Choose an arbitrary starting vertex (let's call it `u`).
   - Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store edges and their weights.
   - Initialize the `key` array where `key[i]` is the minimum weight to connect vertex `i` to the MST. Set `key[u]` to `0` (to pick the starting vertex first) and all other `key` values to infinity.
   - Initialize the `parent` array where `parent[i]` will store the parent vertex of `i` in the MST.
   - Initialize a boolean array `inMST` to track vertices included in the MST.

2. **Algorithm Execution**:
   - Insert the starting vertex `u` into the priority queue.
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Extract the vertex `v` with the minimum key value from the priority queue.
     - Include `v` in the MST by setting `inMST[v]` to `True`.
     - For each adjacent vertex `w` of `v`, check if `w` is not in the MST and if the weight of edge `(v, w)` is less than the current key value of `w`:
       - Update the key value of `w`.
       - Update the parent of `w` to `v`.
       - Insert or update the vertex `w` in the priority queue with the new key value.

3. **Construct the MST**:
   - After the loop terminates, the MST is constructed using the `parent` array.

### Pseudocode

```python
def prims_algorithm(graph, start_vertex):
    num_vertices = len(graph)
    key = [float('inf')] * num_vertices
    parent = [-1] * num_vertices
    inMST = [False] * num_vertices
    
    key[start_vertex] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start_vertex)]  # (key, vertex)
    
    while priority_queue:
        key_val, u = heappop(priority_queue)
        
        inMST[u] = True
        
        for v, weight in graph[u]:
            if not inMST[v] and weight < key[v]:
                key[v] = weight
                parent[v] = u
                heappush(priority_queue, (key[v], v))
    
    # Construct the MST using the parent array
    mst_edges = []
    for v in range(num_vertices):
        if parent[v] != -1:
            mst_edges.append((parent[v], v, key[v]))
    
    return mst_edges
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm depends on the data structures used:
- Using a simple priority queue implemented with a binary heap:
  - Initializing the priority queue takes \(O(V)\).
  - Extracting the minimum element from the priority queue and updating keys take \(O(log V)\).
  - For each of the \(V\) vertices, updating the priority queue for all adjacent vertices (which involves edge relaxation) will take \(O(E log V)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(E log V)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is primarily determined by the storage of the graph, the priority queue, and auxiliary arrays (`key`, `parent`, `inMST`):
- Graph storage: \(O(E + V)\)
- Priority queue: \(O(V)\)
- Arrays (`key`, `parent`, `inMST`): \(O(V)\)

Thus, the overall space complexity is \(O(E + V)\).

### Example

Consider the following graph:

```
   2      3
A---B-------C
|\   |    / |
| 1\ | 2 /  | 4
|   \| /    |
D----E-----F
  \      /
   6    5
```

1. Start with vertex `A`.
2. Pick the edge with the smallest weight from `A`, which is `A-D` (weight 1).
3. Update the priority queue and continue this process until all vertices are included in the MST.

The resulting MST might be:

```
A-D (1)
A-B (2)
B-C (3)
C-F (4)
B-E (2)
E-F (5)
```

This covers all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.

### Conclusion

Prim's Algorithm is an efficient way to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a weighted undirected graph, especially when using a priority queue to manage the edges. Its time complexity of \(O(E log V)\) makes it suitable for dense graphs where \(E\) is much larger than \(V\). The space complexity is also reasonable, making it a practical choice for large graphs.
