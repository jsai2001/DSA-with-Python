### Bridges In a Graph

Finding bridges in a graph is a classical problem in graph theory. A bridge (or cut-edge) in an undirected graph is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components of the graph. In other words, removing a bridge will disconnect the graph.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)

## Algorithm Explanation

To find all bridges in a graph, we can use a modified Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to use DFS traversal to find the discovery and the lowest reachable time for each vertex. By comparing these times, we can identify bridges.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Discovery and Low Arrays**:
   - `discovery[u]`: Time when vertex `u` is first visited.
   - `low[u]`: The earliest visited vertex reachable from `u` or its descendants.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each unvisited vertex, perform a DFS.
   - Track the discovery time of each vertex.
   - Update the `low` values during the DFS traversal.

3. **Bridge Identification**:
   - For an edge `(u, v)`, if `low[v] > discovery[u]`, then `(u, v)` is a bridge.

## Pseudocode

```python
def find_bridges(graph):
    def dfs(u, parent):
        nonlocal time
        discovery[u] = low[u] = time
        time += 1
        for v in graph[u]:
            if discovery[v] == -1:  # v is not visited
                parent[v] = u
                dfs(v, parent)
                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])
                if low[v] > discovery[u]:
                    bridges.append((u, v))
            elif v != parent[u]:  # Update low value of u for parent function calls.
                low[u] = min(low[u], discovery[v])

    n = len(graph)  # Number of vertices
    discovery = [-1] * n
    low = [-1] * n
    parent = [-1] * n
    bridges = []
    time = 0

    # Call the recursive helper function to find Bridges
    for i in range(n):
        if discovery[i] == -1:
            dfs(i, parent)

    return bridges
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `discovery` and `low` arrays are initialized to `-1` to indicate unvisited vertices.
   - `parent` array is used to track the parent vertices during DFS.
   - `bridges` list stores the bridges found.
   - `time` variable is used to keep track of the discovery time of vertices.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each vertex `u`, if it is unvisited, start a DFS from `u`.
   - Set the `discovery` and `low` values of `u` to the current time and increment the time.
   - For each adjacent vertex `v` of `u`:
     - If `v` is unvisited, recursively perform DFS on `v`, update the `low` value of `u` based on the `low` value of `v`.
     - If `low[v] > discovery[u]`, then `(u, v)` is a bridge.
     - If `v` is already visited and `v` is not the parent of `u`, update the `low` value of `u` based on the `discovery` value of `v`.

3. **Bridge Identification**:
   - During the DFS, bridges are identified and added to the `bridges` list.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and edge is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(V)\) for the `discovery`, `low`, and `parent` arrays, and the recursive call stack in the worst case. The `bridges` list also takes space proportional to the number of bridges, which can be at most \(E\). Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(V + E)\).

### Example Usage

Let's assume we have the following undirected graph represented as an adjacency list:

```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1, 3, 4],
    3: [2, 4],
    4: [2, 3, 5],
    5: [4]
}
```

To find the bridges in this graph, we call:

```python
bridges = find_bridges(graph)
print(bridges)  # Output: [(4, 5)]
```

This output indicates that the edge (4, 5) is a bridge in the graph.

To understand how the algorithm works, let's go through an example step-by-step.

### Example Graph

Consider the following undirected graph:

```
   0
  / \
 1---2
      \
       3
      / \
     4   5
```

We can represent this graph using an adjacency list:

```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1, 3],
    3: [2, 4, 5],
    4: [3],
    5: [3]
}
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `discovery = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `low = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `parent = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `bridges = []`
   - `time = 0`

2. **DFS Traversal**:

   - Start DFS from vertex `0`:
     - `discovery[0] = 0`, `low[0] = 0`, `time = 1`
     - Explore vertex `1` from `0`:
       - `discovery[1] = 1`, `low[1] = 1`, `parent[1] = 0`, `time = 2`
       - Vertex `0` is already visited and is the parent, so update `low[1] = min(low[1], discovery[0]) = 0`
       - Explore vertex `2` from `1`:
         - `discovery[2] = 2`, `low[2] = 2`, `parent[2] = 1`, `time = 3`
         - Vertex `0` is already visited and is the parent, so update `low[2] = min(low[2], discovery[0]) = 0`
         - Vertex `1` is already visited and is the parent, so update `low[2] = min(low[2], discovery[1]) = 0`
         - Explore vertex `3` from `2`:
           - `discovery[3] = 3`, `low[3] = 3`, `parent[3] = 2`, `time = 4`
           - Explore vertex `4` from `3`:
             - `discovery[4] = 4`, `low[4] = 4`, `parent[4] = 3`, `time = 5`
             - Vertex `3` is already visited and is the parent, so update `low[4] = min(low[4], discovery[3]) = 3`
             - Since `low[4] > discovery[3]`, edge `(3, 4)` is a bridge. Add `(3, 4)` to `bridges`.
           - Backtrack to vertex `3`, update `low[3] = min(low[3], low[4]) = 3`
           - Explore vertex `5` from `3`:
             - `discovery[5] = 5`, `low[5] = 5`, `parent[5] = 3`, `time = 6`
             - Vertex `3` is already visited and is the parent, so update `low[5] = min(low[5], discovery[3]) = 3`
             - Since `low[5] > discovery[3]`, edge `(3, 5)` is a bridge. Add `(3, 5)` to `bridges`.
           - Backtrack to vertex `3`, update `low[3] = min(low[3], low[5]) = 3`
         - Backtrack to vertex `2`, update `low[2] = min(low[2], low[3]) = 0`
         - Since `low[3] > discovery[2]`, edge `(2, 3)` is a bridge. Add `(2, 3)` to `bridges`.
       - Backtrack to vertex `1`, update `low[1] = min(low[1], low[2]) = 0`
     - Backtrack to vertex `0`, update `low[0] = min(low[0], low[1]) = 0`
     - Explore vertex `2` from `0`:
       - Vertex `2` is already visited and is the parent, so update `low[0] = min(low[0], discovery[2]) = 0`

3. **Bridge Identification**:
   - During the DFS, the following bridges were identified and added to the `bridges` list:
     - `(3, 4)`
     - `(3, 5)`
     - `(2, 3)`

### Final Output

The identified bridges in the graph are:

```python
bridges = [(3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 3)]
```

### Summary

1. **Discovery and Low Arrays**:
   - `discovery`: The time when each vertex is first visited.
   - `low`: The earliest visited vertex reachable from the subtree rooted with that vertex.

2. **Bridge Condition**:
   - An edge `(u, v)` is a bridge if `low[v] > discovery[u]`.

3. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Traverse each vertex, update discovery and low values, and check the bridge condition.

This algorithm efficiently finds all the bridges in the graph using a single DFS traversal with a time complexity of \(O(V + E)\).
