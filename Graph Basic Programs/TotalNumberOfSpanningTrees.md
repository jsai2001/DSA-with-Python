### Total Number Of Spanning Trees In a Graph

To solve the problem of finding the total number of spanning trees in a graph using Python, we can use Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem. This theorem states that the number of spanning trees of a graph can be found using the determinant of a matrix derived from the Laplacian matrix of the graph.

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\)

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)

### Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem:
1. Compute the Laplacian matrix \(L\) of the graph.
2. Remove any one row and the corresponding column from \(L\) to obtain a cofactor matrix \(L'\).
3. The determinant of \(L'\) gives the number of spanning trees of the graph.

### Steps:
1. Construct the adjacency matrix \(A\) of the graph.
2. Construct the degree matrix \(D\) of the graph, which is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element is the degree of the corresponding vertex.
3. Compute the Laplacian matrix \(L = D - A\).
4. Remove any row and the corresponding column from \(L\) to get the cofactor matrix \(L'\).
5. Compute the determinant of \(L'\).

### Python Implementation:

Here's the detailed Python code for finding the number of spanning trees in a graph, including the calculation of time complexity and space complexity:

```python
import numpy as np

def count_spanning_trees(adj_matrix):
    """
    Count the number of spanning trees in a graph using Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem.

    Parameters:
    adj_matrix (numpy.ndarray): Adjacency matrix of the graph

    Returns:
    int: Number of spanning trees
    """
    n = adj_matrix.shape[0]

    # Degree matrix
    degree_matrix = np.diag(np.sum(adj_matrix, axis=1))

    # Laplacian matrix
    laplacian_matrix = degree_matrix - adj_matrix

    # Remove the last row and column to form the cofactor matrix
    cofactor_matrix = laplacian_matrix[:-1, :-1]

    # Number of spanning trees is the determinant of the cofactor matrix
    num_spanning_trees = int(round(np.linalg.det(cofactor_matrix)))

    return num_spanning_trees

# Example usage
adj_matrix = np.array([
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
])

print(f"Number of spanning trees: {count_spanning_trees(adj_matrix)}")
```

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
1. **Constructing the degree matrix**: This requires summing up each row of the adjacency matrix, which takes \(O(n^2)\) time.
2. **Forming the Laplacian matrix**: This is a subtraction operation between two \(n \times n\) matrices, which takes \(O(n^2)\) time.
3. **Forming the cofactor matrix**: Removing a row and column from an \(n \times n\) matrix takes \(O(n^2)\) time, but it's a simple index slicing operation in Python.
4. **Computing the determinant**: The determinant calculation for an \((n-1) \times (n-1)\) matrix using standard algorithms (like LU decomposition) takes \(O((n-1)^3)\), which simplifies to \(O(n^3)\) time.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the determinant calculation, resulting in an **overall time complexity of \(O(n^3)\)**.

#### Space Complexity:
1. **Adjacency matrix**: This requires \(O(n^2)\) space.
2. **Degree matrix**: This also requires \(O(n^2)\) space, although it is sparse.
3. **Laplacian matrix**: This requires \(O(n^2)\) space.
4. **Cofactor matrix**: This requires \(O((n-1)^2)\) space, which is essentially \(O(n^2)\).

Overall, the space complexity is **\(O(n^2)\)** due to storing various \(n \times n\) matrices.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)

This method efficiently computes the number of spanning trees for a given graph using Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem, leveraging matrix operations provided by libraries like NumPy.
