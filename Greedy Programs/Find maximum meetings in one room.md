### Find maximum meetings in one room

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The key idea is to select the meetings that finish the earliest and don't overlap with the previously selected meetings. This ensures that we can maximize the number of meetings in the given time frame.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the meetings by their finish times.** This allows us to always pick the meeting that leaves the room available for the next earliest finishing meeting.
2. **Select the first meeting and add it to the list of selected meetings.**
3. **Iterate through the remaining meetings** and select a meeting if its start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the last selected meeting.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N log N)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Input:**
   - An array of start times, `S`, where `S[i]` is the start time of meeting `i`.
   - An array of finish times, `F`, where `F[i]` is the finish time of meeting `i`.
   - Both arrays are of length `N`.

2. **Output:**
   - A list of meeting indices that represent the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings that can be accommodated.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Create a list of meetings** where each meeting is represented as a tuple `(S[i], F[i], i)`. The third element `i` is the meeting index.
2. **Sort this list of meetings** based on the finish times (`F[i]`).
3. **Initialize an empty list** to store the indices of selected meetings.
4. **Select the first meeting** (since the list is sorted by finish time, the first meeting has the earliest finish time).
5. **Iterate over the sorted list** and for each meeting, if its start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the last selected meeting, add it to the list of selected meetings.
6. **Return the list of selected meeting indices.**

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the list of meetings takes \(O(N log N)\).
- Iterating through the meetings takes \(O(N)\).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(N log N)\).

### Space Complexity:
- Storing the list of meetings and the result list takes \(O(N)\) space.
- Thus, the overall space complexity is \(O(N)\).

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:

```python
def max_meetings(S, F):
    # Number of meetings
    N = len(S)
    
    # List of meetings with their start time, finish time, and index
    meetings = [(S[i], F[i], i + 1) for i in range(N)]
    
    # Sort meetings based on finish time
    meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # List to store the result (indices of selected meetings)
    result = []
    
    # The first meeting always gets selected
    last_meeting_end_time = meetings[0][1]
    result.append(meetings[0][2])
    
    # Iterate over the remaining meetings
    for i in range(1, N):
        if meetings[i][0] >= last_meeting_end_time:
            result.append(meetings[i][2])
            last_meeting_end_time = meetings[i][1]
    
    return result

# Example usage
S = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]
F = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
print("The maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated are:", max_meetings(S, F))
```

### Example

For the input:
```python
S = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]
F = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
```

- Sorted meetings by finish time: `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 2), (5, 7, 4), (0, 6, 3), (8, 9, 5), (5, 9, 6)]`
- Selected meetings (indices): `[1, 2, 4, 5]`

So, the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated are meetings `1, 2, 4, and 5`.
