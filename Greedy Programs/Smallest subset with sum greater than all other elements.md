### Smallest subset with sum greater than all other elements

To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements such that their sum is greater than the sum of the rest of the elements of the array, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the array in descending order**: This allows us to pick the largest elements first, which will help us achieve the required sum faster.
2. **Calculate the total sum of the array**.
3. **Iterate through the sorted array, accumulating the sum of selected elements until it exceeds half of the total sum**: This ensures that the sum of the selected elements is greater than the sum of the rest of the elements.

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N log N) \)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

Here is the detailed explanation, along with the time and space complexity:

### Steps and Explanation

1. **Sort the array in descending order**:
   - Sorting helps us quickly reach a sum greater than half of the total sum by selecting the largest elements first.
   
2. **Calculate the total sum of the array**:
   - This gives us a benchmark to determine when the selected sum exceeds half of the total sum.

3. **Iterate through the sorted array and keep a running sum**:
   - Accumulate the elements' sum and count the number of elements added.
   - Stop when the accumulated sum exceeds half of the total sum.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the array takes \(O(n log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
  - Iterating through the array to accumulate the sum takes \(O(n)\).
  - Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n log n)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Sorting can be done in place, so the space complexity for sorting is \(O(1)\) if we don't consider the input array as extra space.
  - We use a few extra variables for sum accumulation and counting, so the extra space complexity is \(O(1)\).
  - Overall, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

### Python Code Implementation

```python
def min_elements_for_greater_sum(arr):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate the total sum of the array
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    
    # Initialize the sum of selected elements and the count
    selected_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted array and accumulate the sum
    for num in arr:
        selected_sum += num
        count += 1
        # Check if the selected sum is greater than half of the total sum
        if selected_sum > total_sum / 2:
            return count

    return count

# Example usage
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
print(min_elements_for_greater_sum(arr))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation of the Example

For the array \([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\):
1. **Sorted array**: \([9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]\)
2. **Total sum**: \(3 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 9 = 23\)
3. **Half of total sum**: \(23 / 2 = 11.5\)

- Start adding from the largest element:
  - \(9\) (selected sum = 9, count = 1)
  - \(9 + 5 = 14\) (selected sum = 14, count = 2)

The selected sum \(14\) is greater than \(11.5\), so the minimum number of elements required is \(2\).

This approach ensures that we find the minimum number of elements with the required sum efficiently.
