### Maximum trains for which stoppage can be provided

To solve the problem of determining the maximum number of trains that can be provided stoppage at a station, we need to consider several factors:

1. Each train has an arrival time, departure time, and a required platform number.
2. If a train stops at the station, it occupies the required platform from its arrival time to its departure time.
3. We need to maximize the number of trains that can be accommodated on the platforms without overlapping.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \log m)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

Here's a detailed step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Parse the Input
We are given `m` trains with their arrival time, departure time, and required platform number.

### Step 2: Sort the Trains
Sort the trains based on their departure times. This is a greedy approach to ensure that trains that leave earlier are considered first, allowing more room for subsequent trains.

### Step 3: Use a Platform Tracker
Use a list or dictionary to keep track of the end time (departure time) of the train currently occupying each platform.

### Step 4: Allocate Platforms
Iterate over the sorted list of trains and try to allocate the required platform. If the platform is free (i.e., the last departure time is less than or equal to the current arrival time), allocate it to the current train and update the departure time for that platform.

### Step 5: Count the Allocated Trains
Count the number of trains that successfully get a platform.

### Pseudocode

Here is the pseudocode for the above steps:

```python
def max_trains(m, trains):
    # Sort trains based on departure time
    trains.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Dictionary to track the latest departure time for each platform
    platform_tracker = {}
    
    # Count of trains that can be accommodated
    count = 0
    
    for train in trains:
        arrival, departure, platform = train
        
        # Check if the platform is free
        if platform not in platform_tracker or platform_tracker[platform] <= arrival:
            # Allocate the platform to the current train
            platform_tracker[platform] = departure
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting**: We sort the trains based on their departure times. This helps in making sure that we are always considering the earliest finishing train first.
2. **Platform Tracking**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the last departure time for each platform. This helps in efficiently checking whether a platform is free for a new train.
3. **Allocation**: For each train, we check if its required platform is free. If it is free, we allocate it to the train and update the departure time for that platform.
4. **Counting**: We increment our count for each train that gets a platform.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity**:
- Sorting the trains: \(O(m \log m)\)
- Iterating through the trains: \(O(m)\)
Overall, the time complexity is \(O(m \log m)\).

**Space Complexity**:
- The space used by the dictionary to track platforms: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of platforms.
Overall, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Example

Let's consider an example with 4 trains and 2 platforms:

| Train | Arrival | Departure | Platform |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| T1    | 10:00   | 10:30     | 1        |
| T2    | 10:15   | 10:45     | 1        |
| T3    | 10:30   | 11:00     | 2        |
| T4    | 10:45   | 11:15     | 1        |

1. **Sort by Departure**:
   - T1 (10:30)
   - T2 (10:45)
   - T3 (11:00)
   - T4 (11:15)

2. **Allocate Platforms**:
   - T1 occupies Platform 1 from 10:00 to 10:30.
   - T2 cannot be allocated to Platform 1 (occupied until 10:30).
   - T3 occupies Platform 2 from 10:30 to 11:00.
   - T4 occupies Platform 1 from 10:45 to 11:15.

3. **Count of Trains**: 3 trains (T1, T3, T4) can be accommodated.

By following this approach, we can efficiently determine the maximum number of trains that can be accommodated at the station given the constraints on platforms and train schedules.
