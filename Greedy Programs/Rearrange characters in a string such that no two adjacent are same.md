### Rearrange characters in a string such that no two adjacent are same

To solve the problem of rearranging characters in a string such that no two adjacent characters are the same, we can use a greedy approach combined with a max-heap (priority queue) to always place the most frequent characters first, ensuring that they are not adjacent. Below is a detailed step-by-step solution along with its time and space complexity analysis.

### Solution

1. **Count the frequency of each character** in the input string.
2. **Use a max-heap** to store characters along with their frequencies. The heap helps in always extracting the character with the highest frequency.
3. **Reconstruct the string** by placing the characters in such a way that no two adjacent characters are the same.
4. **Return the rearranged string** if possible; otherwise, return an indication that it's not possible.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n log k)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

Here's the Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import Counter

def rearrange_string(s: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    frequency = Counter(s)
    
    # Step 2: Use a max-heap to store characters by their frequencies
    max_heap = []
    for char, freq in frequency.items():
        heappush(max_heap, (-freq, char))  # Push with negative frequency to simulate max-heap
    
    prev_char, prev_freq = None, 0
    result = []
    
    # Step 3: Reconstruct the string
    while max_heap:
        freq, char = heappop(max_heap)
        result.append(char)
        
        # Push the previous character back if its count is > 0
        if prev_freq < 0:
            heappush(max_heap, (prev_freq, prev_char))
        
        # Update the previous character and its frequency
        prev_char, prev_freq = char, freq + 1  # Decrement the frequency
    
    rearranged_string = ''.join(result)
    
    # Step 4: Check if the rearranged string is valid
    for i in range(1, len(rearranged_string)):
        if rearranged_string[i] == rearranged_string[i - 1]:
            return "Not possible to rearrange"
    
    return rearranged_string

# Example usage
s = "aaabbc"
print(rearrange_string(s))  # Output could be "ababac" or any other valid arrangement
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting frequencies:** We use the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Max-heap construction:** We push each character with its negative frequency into a max-heap. This allows us to always extract the character with the highest remaining frequency.
3. **String reconstruction:** We repeatedly extract the character with the highest frequency from the heap and append it to the result. If the previous character still has a remaining count, we push it back into the heap to be used later. This ensures no two adjacent characters are the same.
4. **Validation:** After constructing the string, we check if any two adjacent characters are the same. If they are, it means rearrangement was not possible.

### Time Complexity

- **Counting frequencies:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
- **Heap operations:** Each insertion and extraction operation in the heap takes \(O(log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique characters. Since each character is inserted and removed from the heap once, the total complexity for heap operations is \(O(n log k)\).
- **Validation:** \(O(n)\) to check the rearranged string.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n log k)\).

### Space Complexity

- **Frequency counter:** \(O(k)\) to store the frequency of each character.
- **Max-heap:** \(O(k)\) to store the characters in the heap.
- **Result string:** \(O(n)\) to store the rearranged string.

Overall, the space complexity is \(O(n + k)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\) if \(k <= n\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently rearrange the string while maintaining the constraint that no two adjacent characters are the same.
