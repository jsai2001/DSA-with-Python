### Choose and Swap

You are given a string str of lower case english alphabets. You can choose any two characters in the string and replace all the occurences of the first character with the second character and replace all the occurences of the second character with the first character. Your aim is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by doing this operation at most once.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `str` consisting of lowercase English alphabets. You can choose any two distinct characters in the string and replace all occurrences of the first character with the second character and vice versa. Your aim is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing this operation at most once.

## Detailed Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to determine the optimal characters to swap to achieve the lexicographically smallest string. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Character Pairs:**
   - Consider all pairs of distinct characters in the string.
   - For each pair, simulate the swap and check if the resulting string is smaller than the current smallest string found.

2. **Simulation of Swap:**
   - For each character pair, create a new string where all occurrences of the first character are replaced by the second and vice versa.
   - Compare the resulting string with the current smallest string and update the smallest string if necessary.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Iterate through the string once to identify all unique characters.
   - Use these unique characters to form the pairs to be swapped.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - Compare all generated strings from the swap operations and return the smallest one.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Finding all unique characters in the string takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
  - For each pair of unique characters, creating the new string and comparing it takes \(O(n)\).
  - The number of unique characters is at most 26 (since there are 26 lowercase English alphabets), so the maximum number of pairs is \( \binom{26}{2} = 325 \).
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + 325 \cdot n) = O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space required to store the unique characters is \(O(1)\) since there are at most 26 unique characters.
  - The space required to store the new strings generated during swaps is \(O(n)\).
  - Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(n)\).

## Implementation

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def lexicographically_smallest_string(s):
    from itertools import combinations
    
    def swap_chars(s, char1, char2):
        table = str.maketrans(char1 + char2, char2 + char1)
        return s.translate(table)
    
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    smallest_string = s
    
    for char1, char2 in combinations(unique_chars, 2):
        swapped_string = swap_chars(s, char1, char2)
        if swapped_string < smallest_string:
            smallest_string = swapped_string
    
    return smallest_string

# Example usage:
input_str = "bca"
print(lexicographically_smallest_string(input_str))  # Output: "acb"
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function `swap_chars`:**
   - This function takes a string `s` and two characters `char1` and `char2`.
   - It creates a translation table using `str.maketrans` and translates the string `s` accordingly.

2. **Main Function `lexicographically_smallest_string`:**
   - It first finds all unique characters in the string and sorts them.
   - It initializes the smallest string as the original string.
   - It then iterates over all pairs of unique characters and generates the swapped string.
   - If the swapped string is lexicographically smaller, it updates the smallest string.
   - Finally, it returns the smallest string.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping any two characters at most once.
