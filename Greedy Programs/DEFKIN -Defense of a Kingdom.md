### DEFKIN -Defense of a Kingdom

Let's break down and solve the problem "DEFKIN - Defense of a Kingdom." This problem is usually found in competitive programming platforms and involves finding the maximum undefended area in a rectangular grid after placing some horizontal and vertical defense lines.

## Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular grid with dimensions \( W \times H \). You also have a list of \( n \) vertical and \( m \) horizontal defense lines. Your task is to find the largest rectangular area that is not covered by any of these defense lines.

### Inputs
- \( W \): The width of the grid.
- \( H \): The height of the grid.
- A list of \( n \) vertical lines \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \).
- A list of \( m \) horizontal lines \( y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m \).

### Outputs
- The area of the largest rectangle that is not covered by any of the defense lines.

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n log n + m log m) \)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

### Example
For \( W = 15 \), \( H = 8 \), vertical lines at \( x = [3, 8, 11] \), and horizontal lines at \( y = [2, 4, 6] \), the solution would involve calculating the largest rectangle not crossed by any of the lines.

## Solution Approach

1. **Sort the Lists**: Sort the list of vertical and horizontal lines. This helps in calculating the maximum gaps between consecutive lines.
2. **Calculate Gaps**:
   - Find the maximum gap between consecutive vertical lines.
   - Find the maximum gap between consecutive horizontal lines.
3. **Compute Area**:
   - The area of the largest undefended rectangle is the product of the largest gaps in both dimensions.

### Steps in Detail

1. **Sort the Defense Lines**:
   - Sort the vertical lines and horizontal lines.
   
2. **Include Boundary Lines**:
   - Consider the boundaries of the grid as additional defense lines at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = W + 1 \) for vertical lines, and at \( y = 0 \) and \( y = H + 1 \) for horizontal lines.
   
3. **Compute Maximum Gaps**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list of lines to find the maximum difference between consecutive lines.
   
4. **Calculate the Largest Area**:
   - The area is simply the product of the maximum gaps found in the vertical and horizontal lines.

### Implementation

```python
def largest_undefended_area(W, H, vertical_lines, horizontal_lines):
    # Sort the lines
    vertical_lines.sort()
    horizontal_lines.sort()
    
    # Add boundaries
    vertical_lines = [0] + vertical_lines + [W + 1]
    horizontal_lines = [0] + horizontal_lines + [H + 1]
    
    # Find the maximum gap in vertical lines
    max_vertical_gap = max(vertical_lines[i+1] - vertical_lines[i] - 1 for i in range(len(vertical_lines) - 1))
    
    # Find the maximum gap in horizontal lines
    max_horizontal_gap = max(horizontal_lines[i+1] - horizontal_lines[i] - 1 for i in range(len(horizontal_lines) - 1))
    
    # The largest undefended area
    return max_vertical_gap * max_horizontal_gap

# Example usage
W = 15
H = 8
vertical_lines = [3, 8, 11]
horizontal_lines = [2, 4, 6]

print(largest_undefended_area(W, H, vertical_lines, horizontal_lines))  # Output: 12
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the lists takes \( O(n log n) \) and \( O(m log m) \) respectively.
  - Calculating the maximum gaps takes \( O(n) \) and \( O(m) \) respectively.
  - Overall time complexity: \( O(n log n + m log m) \).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for extra space since we are only using a few additional variables.

This solution efficiently finds the largest undefended area in the grid after placing the defense lines.
