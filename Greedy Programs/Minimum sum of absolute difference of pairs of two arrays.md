### Minimum sum of absolute difference of pairs of two arrays

To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of absolute differences between pairs of elements from two arrays, we can follow an optimal approach that involves sorting both arrays and then pairing the elements based on their positions. This ensures that the absolute differences are minimized.

## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `A` and `B`, each of size `n`, we need to pair elements from `A` and `B` such that the sum of absolute differences between the paired elements is minimized.

## Approach

1. **Sort both arrays:** Sorting both arrays ensures that we can pair the smallest elements together, the second smallest elements together, and so on. This minimizes the absolute differences.

2. **Pair corresponding elements:** Once the arrays are sorted, we pair the elements at the same index in both arrays and compute the sum of their absolute differences.

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N log N) \)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

## Steps

1. **Sort Array `A`**: Sort the first array `A` in non-decreasing order.
2. **Sort Array `B`**: Sort the second array `B` in non-decreasing order.
3. **Compute the sum**: Initialize a variable `min_sum` to zero. For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, compute the absolute difference between `A[i]` and `B[i]`, and add it to `min_sum`.

## Algorithm

Here is the algorithm:

```python
def min_sum_of_absolute_differences(A, B):
    # Step 1: Sort both arrays
    A.sort()
    B.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the minimum sum to zero
    min_sum = 0
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of absolute differences
    for i in range(len(A)):
        min_sum += abs(A[i] - B[i])
    
    return min_sum
```

## Example

Consider the following example:

```python
A = [4, 1, 8, 7]
B = [2, 3, 6, 5]

# Sorted arrays:
# A = [1, 4, 7, 8]
# B = [2, 3, 5, 6]

# Pairing:
# (1, 2) -> |1 - 2| = 1
# (4, 3) -> |4 - 3| = 1
# (7, 5) -> |7 - 5| = 2
# (8, 6) -> |8 - 6| = 2

# Minimum sum of absolute differences = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6
```

## Time Complexity

1. Sorting both arrays takes \(O(n log n)\) time.
2. Computing the sum of absolute differences takes \(O(n)\) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n log n)\).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) if we do the sorting in-place. However, if we consider the input space, it is \(O(n)\) for the input arrays `A` and `B`.

## Conclusion

The above approach provides an optimal solution to the problem of finding the minimum sum of absolute differences of pairs from two arrays by leveraging sorting to ensure minimal differences. This solution is efficient in both time and space, making it suitable for large inputs.
