### Minimum Cost to cut a board into squares

To solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to cut a board into squares, we can use a greedy algorithm. The problem can be framed as follows:

Given a board of size \( m \times n \), where the cost of each horizontal and vertical cut is provided in two arrays \( X[] \) and \( Y[] \) respectively, our goal is to find the minimum total cost to cut the board into 1x1 squares.

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(m \log m + n \log n) \)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

## Detailed Explanation

### Problem Breakdown
1. We have a board with dimensions \( m \times n \).
2. Cutting the board horizontally incurs a cost from array \( X[] \).
3. Cutting the board vertically incurs a cost from array \( Y[] \).

### Approach
To minimize the cost, we should always make the most expensive cut first. This is because making the expensive cuts earlier affects fewer pieces, and thus the cost does not get multiplied as much. 

### Steps
1. **Sort the cost arrays** \( X[] \) and \( Y[] \) in descending order.
2. Use a greedy approach to iterate through both arrays and make cuts.
3. Keep track of the number of horizontal and vertical segments created.
4. At each step, decide whether to make a horizontal or vertical cut based on which cut is currently more expensive.
5. Update the total cost accordingly.

### Example
Consider a board with dimensions 6x4, where:
- \( X = [2, 1, 3, 1, 4] \) (cost of horizontal cuts)
- \( Y = [4, 1, 2] \) (cost of vertical cuts)

### Steps
1. Sort \( X \) and \( Y \):
   - \( X = [4, 3, 2, 1, 1] \)
   - \( Y = [4, 2, 1] \)

2. Initialize:
   - \( h\_segments = 1 \) (initial horizontal segments)
   - \( v\_segments = 1 \) (initial vertical segments)
   - \( total\_cost = 0 \)

3. Iterate through the sorted arrays and choose the more expensive cut first:

| Step | Cut Chosen | Updated Cost | h_segments | v_segments | 
|------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| 1    | Horizontal (4) | 4*1 = 4    | 2          | 1          |
| 2    | Vertical (4)   | 4*2 = 8    | 2          | 2          |
| 3    | Horizontal (3) | 3*2 = 6    | 3          | 2          |
| 4    | Vertical (2)   | 2*3 = 6    | 3          | 3          |
| 5    | Horizontal (2) | 2*3 = 6    | 4          | 3          |
| 6    | Horizontal (1) | 1*3 = 3    | 5          | 3          |
| 7    | Horizontal (1) | 1*3 = 3    | 6          | 3          |
| 8    | Vertical (1)   | 1*6 = 6    | 6          | 4          |

Total cost = 4 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 42

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity
1. Sorting the cost arrays: \( O(m \log m + n \log n) \)
2. Iterating through the arrays to make the cuts: \( O(m + n) \)

So the total time complexity is \( O(m \log m + n \log n) \).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \( O(1) \) additional space, as we only use a few extra variables for tracking the segments and total cost.

## Implementation in Python

```python
def min_cost_to_cut_board(X, Y):
    # Sort the cost arrays in descending order
    X.sort(reverse=True)
    Y.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_cost = 0
    h_segments = 1  # initial number of horizontal segments
    v_segments = 1  # initial number of vertical segments
    
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(X) and j < len(Y):
        if X[i] >= Y[j]:
            total_cost += X[i] * v_segments
            h_segments += 1
            i += 1
        else:
            total_cost += Y[j] * h_segments
            v_segments += 1
            j += 1
            
    while i < len(X):
        total_cost += X[i] * v_segments
        i += 1
    
    while j < len(Y):
        total_cost += Y[j] * h_segments
        j += 1
    
    return total_cost

# Example usage
X = [2, 1, 3, 1, 4]
Y = [4, 1, 2]
print(min_cost_to_cut_board(X, Y))  # Output: 42
```

This code correctly implements the greedy algorithm to minimize the cost of cutting a board into squares.
