### Count Balanced Binary Trees of Height h

To solve the problem of counting the maximum number of balanced binary trees with a given height \( h \), we can use dynamic programming. Let's break down the approach and then implement it.

- Time Complexity: \( O(h) \)

- Space Complexity: \( O(h) \)

### Key Insights

1. **Balanced Binary Tree Property**: A balanced binary tree of height \( h \) can be formed by:
   - A left subtree of height \( h-1 \) and a right subtree of height \( h-1 \).
   - A left subtree of height \( h-1 \) and a right subtree of height \( h-2 \).
   - A left subtree of height \( h-2 \) and a right subtree of height \( h-1 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Define `dp[h]` as the number of balanced binary trees of height \( h \).
   - Base cases:
     - \( dp[0] = 1 \): A tree of height 0 (an empty tree) is considered balanced.
     - \( dp[1] = 1 \): A tree of height 1 is also trivially balanced (a single node).
   - Recursive relation:
     \[
     dp[h] = (dp[h-1] \cdot dp[h-1] + 2 \cdot dp[h-1] \cdot dp[h-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The term \( dp[h-1] \cdot dp[h-1] \) accounts for both subtrees of height \( h-1 \), and \( 2 \cdot dp[h-1] \cdot dp[h-2] \) accounts for one subtree of height \( h-1 \) and the other of height \( h-2 \), considering both possible configurations.

### Implementation

Let's implement the above logic in Python:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_balanced_binary_trees(h):
    if h == 0:
        return 1
    if h == 1:
        return 1
    
    dp = [0] * (h + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, h + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] * dp[i-1] + 2 * dp[i-1] * dp[i-2]) % MOD
    
    return dp[h]

# Example usage
h = 4
print(count_balanced_binary_trees(h))  # Output should be the number of balanced binary trees of height 4
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We handle the base cases for heights 0 and 1 directly.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` holds the number of balanced binary trees of height `i`.
3. **Recursive Calculation**: For each height from 2 to \( h \), compute `dp[i]` using the previously computed values `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Ensure every operation is performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.

### Example Execution

For `h = 4`, the function `count_balanced_binary_trees(4)` computes the result step-by-step using the described dynamic programming approach and returns the number of balanced binary trees of height 4, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

The time complexity of the provided solution is \( O(h) \), and the space complexity is also \( O(h) \).

### Time Complexity:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The main loop runs \( h-1 \) times to fill in the dynamic programming array from index 2 to \( h \).
2. **Operations Inside the Loop**: Each iteration involves basic arithmetic operations and modulo calculations, which take constant time.

Hence, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the height \( h \), i.e., \( O(h) \).

### Space Complexity:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The space complexity is dominated by the dynamic programming array, which has \( h+1 \) elements.
2. **Additional Variables**: There are a few additional variables like the loop index and the constant \( MOD \), which occupy constant space.

Therefore, the space complexity is linear in terms of the height \( h \), i.e., \( O(h) \).
