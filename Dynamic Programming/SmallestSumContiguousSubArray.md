### Smallest sum contiguous subarray

- Time Complexity: O(n)

- Space Complexity: O(1)

To solve the problem of finding the smallest sum contiguous subarray, we can adapt Kadane's Algorithm, which is typically used to find the maximum sum subarray, to find the minimum sum subarray instead. Below is a Python solution with detailed documentation, as well as an analysis of the time and space complexity.

### Python Solution

```python
def smallest_sum_contiguous_subarray(arr):
    """
    Function to find the smallest sum of a contiguous subarray.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The smallest sum of any contiguous subarray.
    """
    # Initialize min_ending_here and min_so_far to the first element of the array
    min_ending_here = arr[0]
    min_so_far = arr[0]
    
    # Traverse through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Update min_ending_here to the minimum of the current element and the sum of min_ending_here and the current element
        min_ending_here = min(arr[i], min_ending_here + arr[i])
        
        # Update min_so_far to the minimum of min_so_far and min_ending_here
        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, min_ending_here)
        
    return min_so_far

# Example usage:
arr = [3, -4, 2, -3, -1, 7, -5]
print("Smallest sum contiguous subarray:", smallest_sum_contiguous_subarray(arr))
```

### Detailed Documentation

#### Function Description
- **Function Name**: `smallest_sum_contiguous_subarray`
- **Parameters**:
  - `arr` (list): A list of integers, which can contain both positive and negative numbers.
- **Returns**: An integer representing the smallest sum of any contiguous subarray within the input list.

#### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - `min_ending_here`: Tracks the minimum sum of the subarray ending at the current position. Initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `min_so_far`: Tracks the overall minimum sum encountered so far. Also initialized to the first element of the array.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Loop through the array starting from the second element.
   - For each element, update `min_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element alone or the current element plus the previous `min_ending_here`. This ensures that we are considering the smallest possible subarray sum ending at the current element.
   - Update `min_so_far` to be the minimum of itself and `min_ending_here`. This keeps track of the smallest sum encountered across all subarrays checked so far.

3. **Return**:
   - After iterating through the entire array, `min_so_far` holds the smallest sum of any contiguous subarray.

### Time and Space Complexity

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we traverse the array exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each element.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\). We use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array. The variables `min_ending_here` and `min_so_far` occupy a fixed amount of space.

This efficient solution ensures that we can handle even large arrays effectively, both in terms of time and space.
