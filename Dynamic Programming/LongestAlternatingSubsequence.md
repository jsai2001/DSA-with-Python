### Longest Alternating Subsequence (LAS)

- Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

- Space Complexity: \(O(n)\)

A sequence of numbers is called alternating if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The problem is to find the length of the longest alternating subsequence in a given array.

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subsequence that alternates between increasing and decreasing.

### Example

For the array `[1, 5, 4]`:
- The LAS is `[1, 5, 4]` and its length is 3.

For the array `[10, 22, 9, 33, 49, 50, 31, 60]`:
- One of the LAS is `[10, 22, 9, 33, 31, 60]` and its length is 6.

### Approach

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming (DP).

1. **Define DP arrays**:
   - `up[i]`: Length of the longest alternating subsequence ending at index `i` and last difference being positive (arr[i] > arr[i-1]).
   - `down[i]`: Length of the longest alternating subsequence ending at index `i` and last difference being negative (arr[i] < arr[i-1]).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `up[0] = 1`: Any single element is an alternating subsequence of length 1.
   - `down[0] = 1`: Any single element is an alternating subsequence of length 1.

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to n-1:
     - For each `j` from 0 to i-1:
       - If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, update `up[i]` as `max(up[i], down[j] + 1)`.
       - If `arr[i] < arr[j]`, update `down[i]` as `max(down[i], up[j] + 1)`.

4. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum value among all `up[i]` and `down[i]`.

### Pseudocode

```python
def longest_alternating_subsequence(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    up = [1] * n
    down = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                up[i] = max(up[i], down[j] + 1)
            elif arr[i] < arr[j]:
                down[i] = max(down[i], up[j] + 1)

    return max(max(up), max(down))
```

### Example

For the input array `[10, 22, 9, 33, 49, 50, 31, 60]`:

- `up` and `down` arrays will be updated as follows:

  ```
  Initial: up = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Iteration 1: up = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Iteration 2: up = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Iteration 3: up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Iteration 4: up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Iteration 5: up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Iteration 6: up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1]
  Iteration 7: up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 5], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1]
  ```

- The longest alternating subsequence length is `5`.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity**:
- The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because of the nested loops where `i` goes from 1 to \(n-1\) and `j` goes from 0 to \(i-1\).

**Space Complexity**:
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the `up` and `down` arrays.

### Conclusion

The provided dynamic programming approach efficiently calculates the length of the longest alternating subsequence. This method ensures that we consider all potential alternating sequences and keep track of the longest one encountered.

### Derivation of the Longest Alternating Subsequence Logic

To derive the logic for finding the longest alternating subsequence (LAS), let's break down the problem step by step and understand the dynamic programming approach used:

#### 1. Understanding the Problem
An alternating subsequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The goal is to find the length of the longest such subsequence in a given array.

#### 2. Observations
- If we know the length of the longest alternating subsequence ending at each index `i`, we can use this information to build longer subsequences.
- We need to track two types of subsequences:
  1. Subsequence ending with an increasing difference (i.e., `arr[i] > arr[j]`).
  2. Subsequence ending with a decreasing difference (i.e., `arr[i] < arr[j]`).

#### 3. Define Dynamic Programming Arrays
To capture the above observations, we define two arrays:
- `up[i]`: Length of the longest alternating subsequence ending at index `i` with the last difference being positive (i.e., increasing).
- `down[i]`: Length of the longest alternating subsequence ending at index `i` with the last difference being negative (i.e., decreasing).

#### 4. Base Case
For any single element, the longest alternating subsequence is the element itself, so:
- `up[0] = 1`
- `down[0] = 1`

#### 5. Recurrence Relations
To build the solution iteratively:
- For each index `i`, consider all previous indices `j` where `0 <= j < i`.
- If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, it means we can extend a subsequence ending at `j` with a negative difference to include `arr[i]`:
  - `up[i] = max(up[i], down[j] + 1)`
- If `arr[i] < arr[j]`, it means we can extend a subsequence ending at `j` with a positive difference to include `arr[i]`:
  - `down[i] = max(down[i], up[j] + 1)`

#### 6. Result
The length of the longest alternating subsequence is the maximum value among all entries in `up` and `down` arrays.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### Initial Setup
1. **Initialize arrays** `up` and `down` of length `n` (where `n` is the length of the input array) with all elements set to 1. This is because the smallest subsequence at any position is the element itself.

```python
up = [1] * n
down = [1] * n
```

2. **Base Case**:
- Both `up[0]` and `down[0]` are 1 since a single element forms a subsequence of length 1.

```python
up[0] = 1
down[0] = 1
```

#### Dynamic Programming Transition
3. **Iterate through the array**:
- For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, iterate through all previous indices `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(i):
```

4. **Update `up` and `down` arrays**:
- If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, it means we can extend a decreasing subsequence ending at `j` to an increasing one ending at `i`.

```python
if arr[i] > arr[j]:
    up[i] = max(up[i], down[j] + 1)
```

- If `arr[i] < arr[j]`, it means we can extend an increasing subsequence ending at `j` to a decreasing one ending at `i`.

```python
elif arr[i] < arr[j]:
    down[i] = max(down[i], up[j] + 1)
```

#### Final Step
5. **Find the result**:
- The length of the longest alternating subsequence will be the maximum value in both `up` and `down` arrays.

```python
return max(max(up), max(down))
```

### Example to Illustrate

For the input array `[10, 22, 9, 33, 49, 50, 31, 60]`:

- Initialization:
  ```
  up = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  down = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

- Iterating and updating based on the conditions:
  ```
  i = 1: up = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  i = 2: up = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  i = 3: up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1], down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ...
  ```

- Final result:
  ```
  up = [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5]
  down = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1]
  ```
  Maximum value among all entries: `5`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
  - Two nested loops iterate through the array: the outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs up to `n` times.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Additional space for `up` and `down` arrays.

By following this detailed step-by-step approach, we derived the logic for finding the longest alternating subsequence using dynamic programming.
