### Palindrome Partitioning Problem

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)

To solve the problem of finding the fewest cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of a given string, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the solution, along with the time and space complexity analysis:

### Dynamic Programming Solution

1. **Define the Problem:**
   We need to find the minimum number of cuts needed to partition a string such that every substring is a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming Tables:**
   - `dp[i]`: Minimum number of cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of the substring `s[0..i]`.
   - `isPalindrome[i][j]`: Boolean table indicating whether the substring `s[i..j]` is a palindrome.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[i]` initialized to `i` (maximum cuts needed is the length of the substring minus one).

4. **Fill the `isPalindrome` Table:**
   - For every substring `s[i..j]`, determine if it is a palindrome by checking:
     - If `s[i] == s[j]` and
     - The substring `s[i+1..j-1]` is a palindrome (if `j - i > 2`).

5. **Fill the `dp` Table:**
   - For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[0..i]` is a palindrome, `dp[i] = 0` because no cut is needed.
   - Otherwise, for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, if `s[j+1..i]` is a palindrome, update `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

### Algorithm

```python
def minCut(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Initialize the isPalindrome table
    isPalindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Fill the isPalindrome table
    for i in range(n):
        isPalindrome[i][i] = True
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                if length == 2 or isPalindrome[i + 1][j - 1]:
                    isPalindrome[i][j] = True

    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if isPalindrome[0][i]:
            dp[i] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(i):
                if isPalindrome[j + 1][i]:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return dp[n - 1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Filling the `isPalindrome` table:** This requires \(O(n^2)\) time because we need to check each substring, and each check (with memoization) takes constant time.
- **Filling the `dp` table:** This also requires \(O(n^2)\) time because for each `i`, we may need to check up to `i` previous indices to determine the minimum cuts.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\).

### Space Complexity

- **`isPalindrome` table:** Requires \(O(n^2)\) space to store the boolean values for each substring.
- **`dp` array:** Requires \(O(n)\) space to store the minimum cuts for each substring.

Therefore, the overall space complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\).
