### Optimal Strategy For A Game

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)

This problem is a classic example of a game theory problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. The key challenge here is to determine the maximum possible amount of money you can win if both players are playing optimally and you always go first.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve this problem:

### Problem Restatement
Given an array `arr` of size `n`, where each element represents the value of a coin, you and your opponent alternately pick coins from either end of the row. The goal is to maximize the total value of coins you collect. You start first, and both players play optimally.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

To solve this problem, we'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach. The idea is to use a table to store the maximum value of coins that can be collected from any subarray of `arr` by the player who starts first.

### Steps

1. **Define the DP Table:**
   Let `dp[i][j]` be the maximum amount of money that can be won if the coins are only from the subarray `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.

2. **Base Case:**
   When `i == j` (only one coin is available), the player will take that coin:
   \[
   dp[i][j] = arr[i]
   \]

3. **Recursive Relation:**
   For more than one coin, the player has two choices:
   - Take the coin at `arr[i]`, leaving the opponent to play optimally with subarray `arr[i+1]` to `arr[j]`.
   - Take the coin at `arr[j]`, leaving the opponent to play optimally with subarray `arr[i]` to `arr[j-1]`.

   If the player takes `arr[i]`, the opponent will play optimally and try to minimize the player's future gain. Therefore:
   \[
   dp[i][j] = \max(arr[i] + \min(dp[i+2][j], dp[i+1][j-1]), arr[j] + \min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][j-2]))
   \]
   The `min` functions are used because the opponent is also playing optimally and will choose the move that minimizes the player's gain.

4. **Fill the DP Table:**
   We need to fill the table in a way that smaller subproblems (shorter subarrays) are solved before larger subproblems.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation of the above approach in Python:

```python
def max_coin_value(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Create a DP table with all values initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Fill the table for subarrays of length 1 (base case)
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = arr[i]

    # Fill the DP table for subarrays of length 2 to n
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if length == 2:
                dp[i][j] = max(arr[i], arr[j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(
                    arr[i] + min(dp[i + 2][j] if i + 2 <= j else 0, dp[i + 1][j - 1] if i + 1 <= j - 1 else 0),
                    arr[j] + min(dp[i + 1][j - 1] if i + 1 <= j - 1 else 0, dp[i][j - 2] if i <= j - 2 else 0)
                )

    # The result is the maximum value the first player can get from the whole array
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Example usage:
arr = [8, 15, 3, 7]
print("Maximum value the first player can collect:", max_coin_value(arr))
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

1. **Initialization:** We create a 2D list `dp` of size `n x n` initialized to 0. This table will store the maximum coin values for different subarrays.
2. **Base Case:** We initialize `dp[i][i]` for all `i` because if there is only one coin, the player takes it.
3. **Filling the Table:** We iterate over all possible subarray lengths from 2 to `n`. For each subarray, we compute the maximum value using the described recurrence relation.
4. **Result:** The value `dp[0][n-1]` gives the maximum value the first player can collect from the entire array.

This solution efficiently computes the result with a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), making it suitable for arrays of moderate size.
