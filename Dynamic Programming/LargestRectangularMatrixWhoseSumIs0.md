### Largest Rectangular Sub-matrix whose sum is 0

To find the largest rectangular sub-matrix in a given 2D matrix whose sum is 0, we can leverage an approach based on the Kadane's algorithm, which is used for finding the maximum sum subarray in a 1D array. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation along with the analysis of time and space complexity:

- Time complexity is \(O(N^2 . M)\)

- Space complexity is \(O(M)\)

### Approach:

1. **Convert the Problem to 1D Subarray Problem**: We iterate over all pairs of rows and treat each pair as the boundaries of the sub-matrix. For each pair of rows, we then convert the problem into a 1D problem where we find the largest subarray with a sum of 0 in the resulting array of column sums.

2. **Calculate Column Sums**: For each pair of rows (let's call them `rowStart` and `rowEnd`), calculate the sum of the elements for each column between these two rows. This transforms the 2D problem into a 1D problem where each element in the array represents the sum of elements in that column between `rowStart` and `rowEnd`.

3. **Find the Largest Subarray with Sum 0**: For the 1D array of column sums, we need to find the largest subarray with a sum of 0. This can be efficiently done using a hash map to store the first occurrence of a cumulative sum.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - `maxArea` to keep track of the maximum area of the sub-matrix found.
   - `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` to store the coordinates of the sub-matrix.

2. **Iterate Over Row Pairs**:
   - For each pair of rows `rowStart` and `rowEnd` (from `0` to `N-1`), initialize an array `temp` of size `M` to 0. This array will store the column sums between `rowStart` and `rowEnd`.

3. **Calculate Column Sums for Each Pair of Rows**:
   - For each column `col` (from `0` to `M-1`), update `temp[col]` by adding the elements from `rowStart` to `rowEnd` in that column.

4. **Find the Largest Subarray with Sum 0 in `temp`**:
   - Use a hash map to find the largest subarray with a sum of 0 in the `temp` array.
   - If such a subarray is found, calculate its area and update `maxArea` and the coordinates if this subarray is larger than the previously found subarrays.

### Algorithm:

```python
def largest_zero_sum_submatrix(matrix):
    N = len(matrix)
    M = len(matrix[0])
    
    maxArea = 0
    result = None
    
    for rowStart in range(N):
        temp = [0] * M
        
        for rowEnd in range(rowStart, N):
            for col in range(M):
                temp[col] += matrix[rowEnd][col]
            
            # Find the largest subarray with sum 0 in temp
            sum_map = {}
            curr_sum = 0
            temp_start = 0
            for j in range(M):
                curr_sum += temp[j]
                
                if curr_sum == 0:
                    area = (rowEnd - rowStart + 1) * (j + 1)
                    if area > maxArea:
                        maxArea = area
                        result = (rowStart, 0, rowEnd, j)
                
                if curr_sum in sum_map:
                    start = sum_map[curr_sum] + 1
                    area = (rowEnd - rowStart + 1) * (j - start + 1)
                    if area > maxArea:
                        maxArea = area
                        result = (rowStart, start, rowEnd, j)
                else:
                    sum_map[curr_sum] = j
    
    return maxArea, result

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, -2, -1],
    [3, 4, 5, 6],
    [-3, -4, 0, 0],
    [2, 2, -2, -2]
]
print(largest_zero_sum_submatrix(matrix))
```

### Time Complexity:

- The outer loop runs `N` times.
- The inner loop (pair of rows) also runs `N` times.
- Inside the inner loop, updating the `temp` array takes `O(M)` time.
- Finding the largest subarray with sum 0 using the hash map takes `O(M)` time.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(N^2 . M)\).

### Space Complexity:

- We use an additional array `temp` of size `M` which is `O(M)`.
- The hash map used to store cumulative sums will at most have `M` entries, so it also takes `O(M)` space.

Thus, the space complexity is \(O(M)\).
