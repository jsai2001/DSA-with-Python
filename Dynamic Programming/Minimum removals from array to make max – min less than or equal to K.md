To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove from an array such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the remaining elements is at most \( K \), we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach combined with sorting. Let's walk through the solution step by step:

### Problem Restatement
Given an array \( A \) of \( N \) integers and an integer \( K \), find the minimum number of elements to remove such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining elements is at most \( K \).

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N log N) \)
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(N) \)

### Solution Explanation

1. **Sort the Array**: First, we sort the array. This simplifies the problem because once sorted, any subarray of \( A \) will have its minimum and maximum values at the two ends of the subarray.

2. **Use Two-Pointer Technique**: We'll use a two-pointer technique to find the longest subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is less than or equal to \( K \).

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**:
   - Define \( dp[i] \) as the minimum number of elements to remove from the first \( i \) elements of the array to make the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the remaining elements at most \( K \).

4. **Transition**:
   - For each element \( A[i] \) (considering \( A \) is sorted), use a second pointer \( j \) to find the longest subarray ending at \( i \) such that \( A[i] - A[j] \leq K \). This can be efficiently done using a while loop.
   - If such a \( j \) is found, the subarray from \( j \) to \( i \) satisfies the condition, and we update \( dp[i] \) accordingly.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The answer will be \( N \) (total elements) minus the length of the longest subarray that satisfies the condition.

### Steps

1. **Sort the array** \( A \).
2. **Initialize DP array** \( dp \) of size \( N+1 \), where \( dp[i] \) represents the minimum removals for the first \( i \) elements.
3. **Use two-pointer technique** to update the \( dp \) array.
4. **Calculate the result** based on the DP array.

### Code Implementation

```python
# Python3 program for the above approach
# To sort the array and return the answer
def removals(arr, n, k):
    # sort the array
    arr.sort()
    dp = [0 for i in range(n)]

    # Fill all stated with -1
    # when only one element
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = -1

    # As dp[0] = 0 (base case) so min
    # no of elements to be removed are
    # n-1 elements
    ans = n - 1
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = i
        j = dp[i - 1]

        while j != i and arr[i] - arr[j] > k:
            j += 1

        dp[i] = min(dp[i], j)
        ans = min(ans, (n - (i - j + 1)))

    return ans


# Driver code
a = [1, 3, 4, 9, 10]
n = len(a)
k = 3
print(removals(a, n, k))
# Output: 2 , i.e [1,3,4]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array**: \( O(N log N) \)
- **Two-pointer traversal and DP update**: \( O(N) \)
- Total time complexity: \( O(N log N) \)

### Space Complexity
- **DP array**: \( O(N) \)
- Total space complexity: \( O(N) \)

In summary, this approach efficiently finds the minimum number of elements to remove using a combination of sorting and dynamic programming with a two-pointer technique, ensuring the solution is both time and space efficient.

#### Initial Setup
- `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used as the starting index of the subarray.
- The for loop iterates with `i` from 0 to \( N-1 \). Here, `i` represents the ending index of the current subarray.

#### Inner While Loop
- The while loop checks if the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the starting element of the subarray `arr[j]` is greater than \( K \).
- If `arr[i] - arr[j] > K`, it means that the current subarray `[arr[j], arr[j+1], ..., arr[i]]` does not satisfy the condition \( \text{max} - \text{min} \leq K \).
- To correct this, we increment `j` to shrink the subarray from the left until the condition `arr[i] - arr[j] <= K` is met.
- The while loop continues to move `j` to the right until we find a valid subarray or `j` reaches the end of the array.

#### DP Array Update
- Once we have a valid subarray `[arr[j], arr[j+1], ..., arr[i]]` that satisfies the condition, we update the DP array.
- `dp[i + 1]` is updated to the minimum of:
  - `dp[i]`: The number of removals needed for the subarray ending at `i-1`.
  - `i - j + 1`: The number of elements in the subarray from `j` to `i`. This indicates the elements we can keep without removal.
- The idea is that `dp[i + 1]` should represent the minimum removals needed for the first `i+1` elements to satisfy the condition.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting takes \( O(N log N) \). The for loop and while loop together run in \( O(N) \), making the overall time complexity \( O(N log N) \).
- **Space Complexity**: The space used is mainly for the DP array, which is \( O(N) \). Thus, the space complexity is \( O(N) \).
