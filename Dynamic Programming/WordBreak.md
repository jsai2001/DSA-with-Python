### Word Break Problem

To determine if a string `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words, we can use dynamic programming. Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:

- Time Complexity: \(O(n x m)\)

- Space Complexity: \(O(n)\)
### Problem Explanation

We are given:
1. A string `s`.
2. A dictionary of words `dictionary`.

The task is to check if `s` can be broken down into a sequence of words found in the `dictionary`. If it's possible, return 1, otherwise return 0.

### Solution Explanation

We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve this problem. We'll maintain a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words, otherwise `False`.

#### Steps to Solve

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a DP array `dp` of size `len(s) + 1` and initialize all values to `False`.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `True` because an empty string can always be segmented (base case).

2. **DP Array Update**:
   - For each position `i` from 1 to `len(s)`:
     - For each word in the dictionary, check if the word can fit into the substring ending at position `i`. This means checking if `s[i-len(word):i]` equals the current word.
     - If the word fits and the substring before it can be segmented (`dp[i-len(word)]` is `True`), then set `dp[i]` to `True`.

3. **Result**:
   - The value at `dp[len(s)]` will tell us if the entire string can be segmented or not.

### Example

Let's illustrate this with an example:

- **String**: `s = "leetcode"`
- **Dictionary**: `dictionary = ["leet", "code"]`

1. Initialize `dp` array: `dp = [True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]`.
2. Iterate over each position `i` in `s`:
   - At `i = 4`, `s[0:4]` is `"leet"` which is in the dictionary, and `dp[0]` is `True`. Set `dp[4]` to `True`.
   - At `i = 8`, `s[4:8]` is `"code"` which is in the dictionary, and `dp[4]` is `True`. Set `dp[8]` to `True`.
3. The final `dp` array: `dp = [True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, True]`.

Since `dp[8]` is `True`, the string "leetcode" can be segmented into dictionary words.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n x m)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s` and \(m\) is the total length of all words in the dictionary combined. Each position `i` in the string `s` is checked against every word in the dictionary.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. We use a DP array of size \(n + 1\).

### Python Code Implementation

```python
def word_break(s, dictionary):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for word in dictionary:
            if i >= len(word) and s[i-len(word):i] == word:
                dp[i] = dp[i] or dp[i-len(word)]
    
    return 1 if dp[n] else 0

# Example usage:
s = "leetcode"
dictionary = ["leet", "code"]
print(word_break(s, dictionary))  # Output: 1
```

This implementation checks each position in the string to determine if it can be segmented into dictionary words and returns the appropriate result.

You're correct again, my apologies for the confusion. Let's reassess the situation.

For the string "hotscode" and the dictionary ["leet", "code"], indeed "hots" is not in the dictionary. Therefore, the string "hotscode" cannot be segmented into dictionary words. 

Let's revise the dynamic programming process:

1. Initialize `dp` array: `dp = [True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]`.
2. Iterate over each position `i` in `s`:
   - At `i = 3`, `s[0:3]` is `"hot"`, which is not in the dictionary. `dp[0]` is `True`, so we continue.
   - At `i = 4`, `s[0:4]` is `"hots"`, which is not in the dictionary. `dp[0]` is `True`, so we continue.
   - At `i = 6`, `s[0:6]` is `"hotsco"`, which is not in the dictionary. `dp[0]` is `True`, so we continue.
   - At `i = 8`, `s[4:8]` is `"code"`, which is in the dictionary. However, `dp[4]` is `False`, so we do not set `dp[8]` to `True`.
3. The final `dp` array: `dp = [True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]`.

Since there's no way to segment the string "hotscode" into dictionary words, the result should indeed be `False`.
