Approach to solve the problem of counting subsequences whose product is less than \( K \). This method uses dynamic programming (DP) to build up the solution. Let's break down how this code works:

**Time Complexity**: \(O(k x n)\)

**Space Complexity**: \(O(k x n)\)

### Explanation of the Code

#### Function Definition

```python
def productSubSeqCount(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0 for i in range(n + 1)] for j in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if arr[j - 1] <= i and arr[j - 1] > 0:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1] + 1
    return dp[k][n]
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
    - `n = len(arr)`: Get the length of the input array.
    - `dp = [[0 for i in range(n + 1)] for j in range(k + 1)]`: Initialize a 2D list (table) `dp` of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` with all values set to 0. This table will store the count of subsequences with product less than or equal to \( i \) using the first \( j \) elements of the array.

2. **DP Table Construction**:
    - The outer loop `for i in range(1, k + 1)` iterates over all possible product values from `1` to `k`.
    - The inner loop `for j in range(1, n + 1)` iterates over the array elements.
    
3. **Filling the DP Table**:
    - `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`: Start by copying the value from the previous element in the array, meaning the count of subsequences using up to the first `j-1` elements.
    - `if arr[j - 1] <= i and arr[j - 1] > 0`: Check if the current element `arr[j - 1]` can contribute to subsequences with product `i`:
        - `arr[j - 1] <= i`: The element can be included if it is less than or equal to `i` (current product limit).
        - `arr[j - 1] > 0`: Only consider positive elements (since including zero would make the product zero, which might not be desired).

    - `dp[i][j] += dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1] + 1`: Update the count of subsequences by adding the number of valid subsequences formed with the inclusion of the current element:
        - `dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1]`: The number of subsequences with product `i // arr[j - 1]` using the first `j-1` elements.
        - `+1`: Count the current element itself as a valid subsequence.

4. **Result**:
    - `return dp[k][n]`: The final answer is stored in `dp[k][n]`, which gives the count of subsequences with product less than `k` using all `n` elements of the array.

### Example

Let's go through an example step-by-step to understand how this works:

#### Example Array: `A = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 10`

- **Initialization**:
    - `n = 4`
    - `dp` table is initialized to a \(11 x 5\) table of zeros (since `k + 1 = 11` and `n + 1 = 5`).

#### Iterating and Filling the DP Table

- **For \(i = 1\)**:
    - **For \(j = 1\)**:
        - `arr[0] = 1` which is ≤ 1
        - `dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1 // 1][0] + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
    - **For \(j = 2\)**:
        - `arr[1] = 2` which is > 1, so skip.
    - **For \(j = 3\)**:
        - `arr[2] = 3` which is > 1, so skip.
    - **For \(j = 4\)**:
        - `arr[3] = 4` which is > 1, so skip.

- **For \(i = 2\)**:
    - **For \(j = 1\)**:
        - `arr[0] = 1` which is ≤ 2
        - `dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] + dp[2 // 1][0] + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
    - **For \(j = 2\)**:
        - `arr[1] = 2` which is ≤ 2
        - `dp[2][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[2 // 2][1] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - **For \(j = 3\)**:
        - `arr[2] = 3` which is > 2, so skip.
    - **For \(j = 4\)**:
        - `arr[3] = 4` which is > 2, so skip.

Continue filling the table in this manner...

### Final Result

After all iterations, the final value in `dp[k][n]` (`dp[10][4]`) will contain the count of subsequences whose product is less than `10`.

### Conclusion

This dynamic programming approach efficiently counts the subsequences with a product less than `k` by building up the solution iteratively and reusing previously computed results. It avoids the exponential time complexity of exploring all subsequences directly.

Let's delve into the specific part of the dynamic programming approach:

### Detailed Explanation of `dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1]`

#### Context

- `dp[i][j]` represents the number of subsequences of the first `j` elements of the array `arr` that have a product less than or equal to `i`.
- `arr[j - 1]` is the `j`-th element of the array (considering zero-based indexing).

#### Purpose

When computing `dp[i][j]`, we consider whether to include the `j`-th element (`arr[j - 1]`) in the subsequences counted in `dp[i][j]`.

### Breakdown of `dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1]`

1. **Product Condition**:
    - We want to find the number of subsequences where including `arr[j - 1]` keeps the product under or equal to `i`.
    - To include `arr[j - 1]` in a valid subsequence, the product of the remaining elements must be at most `i / arr[j - 1]`.

2. **Subproblems**:
    - `dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1]` counts subsequences using the first `j-1` elements where the product of those subsequences is at most `i / arr[j - 1]`.
    - This count represents the number of ways we can form subsequences from the first `j-1` elements such that, when `arr[j - 1]` is included, the overall product is still less than or equal to `i`.

### Explanation with an Example

Consider `arr = [1, 2, 3]` and `k = 6`.

#### Initialization:
- `dp[0][*]` is `0` since no subsequence (other than the empty subsequence) has a product of zero.
- `dp[*][0]` is `0` since there are no elements to form subsequences from.

#### Filling the DP Table:

- For `i = 1`:
  - For `j = 1` (`arr[0] = 1`):
    - `dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1 // 1][0] + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
    - Subsequence: [1] (product = 1)

- For `i = 2`:
  - For `j = 1` (`arr[0] = 1`):
    - `dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] + dp[2 // 1][0] + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
    - Subsequence: [1] (product = 1)
  - For `j = 2` (`arr[1] = 2`):
    - `dp[2][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[2 // 2][1] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Subsequences: [1], [2], [1, 2]

- For `i = 3`:
  - For `j = 1` (`arr[0] = 1`):
    - `dp[3][1] = dp[3][0] + dp[3 // 1][0] + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
    - Subsequence: [1] (product = 1)
  - For `j = 2` (`arr[1] = 2`):
    - `dp[3][2] = dp[3][1] + dp[3 // 2][1] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Subsequences: [1], [2], [1, 2]
  - For `j = 3` (`arr[2] = 3`):
    - `dp[3][3] = dp[3][2] + dp[3 // 3][2] + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5`
    - Subsequences: [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3]

### Key Points

- `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`: Start by considering the subsequences without the `j`-th element.
- `if arr[j - 1] <= i`: Check if including `arr[j - 1]` in subsequences is possible without exceeding the product limit `i`.
- `dp[i][j] += dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1] + 1`: Update the count by adding valid subsequences formed with the inclusion of `arr[j - 1]`.

### Conclusion

The `dp[i // arr[j - 1]][j - 1]` term dynamically considers all valid subsequences that can be formed by including the `j`-th element, ensuring the product remains under the limit `i`. This dynamic programming approach efficiently breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, building up the solution iteratively.

### Total Time Complexity
- The total number of iterations of the inner loop for each iteration of the outer loop is \(O(n)\).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(k x n)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the size of the `dp` table:
- The `dp` table has dimensions `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`.

### Total Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(k x n)\) because we need to store \( (k + 1) x (n + 1) \) values in the DP table.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(k x n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k x n)\)

This complexity shows that the code is quite efficient, given the constraints. Both the time and space complexities are not \(O(n^2)\) as initially thought, but rather \(O(k x n)\), which is linear with respect to the number of elements \(n\) and the product limit \(k\).
