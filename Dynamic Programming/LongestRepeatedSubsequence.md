## Longest Repeated Subsequence

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(n^2)

The Longest Repeated Subsequence (LRS) problem is a variant of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. Here, we find the longest subsequence that appears at least twice in the given string, with the characters not having the same positions in both occurrences.

Here's a Python solution to find the LRS length:

```python
def lrs(text):
  """
  This function finds the length of the longest repeating subsequence (LRS) in a string.

  Args:
      text: The input string.

  Returns:
      The length of the LRS in the text.
  """
  n = len(text)

  # Create a DP table to store the lengths of LCS for overlapping subsequences of the given string
  dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

  # Fill the DP table in a bottom-up manner
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
      # If the characters are same and have different indexes, consider them for the LRS
      if text[i - 1] == text[j - 1] and i != j:
        dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
      else:
        # Otherwise, take the maximum LRS length from the previous characters
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

  # The bottom-right corner of the dp table holds the length of the LRS
  return dp[n][n]

# Example usage
text = "aab"
lrs_length = lrs(text)
print("Length of LRS is", lrs_length)
```

This code uses dynamic programming to construct a 2D table `dp`. The `dp[i][j]` cell stores the length of the LCS for the subsequences ending at indexes `i-1` and `j-1` in the original string `text`. The condition `i != j` ensures that characters considered for the LRS don't have the same positions.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the string length.

The space complexity of the given solution for finding the longest repeating subsequence (LRS) is indeed O(n^2).
