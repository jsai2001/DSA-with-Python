To solve the Longest Palindromic Substring problem, we need to find the longest substring within a given string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

#### Explanation

1. **Definition**:
   - A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
   - A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We use a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome.
   - Initialize `dp[i][i]` to `True` for all `i`, since a single character is always a palindrome.
   - Initialize `dp[i][i+1]` to `True` if `s[i] == s[i+1]` for all `i`, as two identical characters side by side form a palindrome.
   - For substrings longer than two characters, use the relation:
     - `dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and dp[i+1][j-1]`
   - Keep track of the longest palindrome found during the process.

3. **Algorithm**:
   ```python
   def longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:
       n = len(s)
       if n <= 1:
           return s

       dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
       start, max_length = 0, 1

       for i in range(n):
           dp[i][i] = True

       for i in range(n - 1):
           if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
               dp[i][i + 1] = True
               start, max_length = i, 2

       for length in range(3, n + 1):
           for i in range(n - length + 1):
               j = i + length - 1
               if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:
                   dp[i][j] = True
                   start, max_length = i, length

       return s[start:start + max_length]
   ```

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm iterates over all possible substring lengths and starting points.
   - Time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.

5. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the 2D table `dp`.

### Approach 2: Expand Around Center

#### Explanation

1. **Definition**:
   - A palindrome can be expanded from its center.

2. **Expand Around Center Approach**:
   - For each character in the string, consider it as the center of a palindrome.
   - Expand outward from each center and keep track of the longest palindrome found.
   - There are 2n-1 centers: each character and each pair of consecutive characters.

3. **Algorithm**:
   ```python
   def expand_around_center(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> str:
       while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
           left -= 1
           right += 1
       return s[left + 1:right]

   def longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:
       n = len(s)
       if n <= 1:
           return s

       longest = ""
       for i in range(n):
           # Odd length palindromes
           odd_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i)
           if len(odd_palindrome) > len(longest):
               longest = odd_palindrome

           # Even length palindromes
           even_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)
           if len(even_palindrome) > len(longest):
               longest = even_palindrome

       return longest
   ```

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm expands around each center up to the length of the string.
   - Time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.

5. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the iterative approach since we use only a few extra variables for tracking.

### Summary

Both approaches have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), but the Expand Around Center approach has a better space complexity of \(O(1)\) compared to the Dynamic Programming approach's \(O(n^2)\). Here's the recommended implementation using the Expand Around Center approach for its simplicity and lower space requirements.
