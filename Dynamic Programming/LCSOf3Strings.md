**Explanation:**

1. **Docstring:** The code begins with a docstring that explains the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. This improves code readability and maintainability.

2. **Function Definition:** The `lcs_three_strings` function takes three strings (`str1`, `str2`, and `str3`) as input and returns the length of their LCS.

3. **Length Calculation:**
   - We calculate the lengths (`m`, `n`, and `p`) of the three input strings and add 1 to each to accommodate empty subsequences in the DP table.

4. **3D DP Table:**
   - A 3D DP table `dp` is created with dimensions `(m x n x p)`. This table will store the lengths of LCS for all possible combinations of prefixes from the three strings.

5. **Base Cases:**
   - The base cases in the DP table initialization correspond to empty subsequences. All elements in the first layer (`i=0`, `j=0`, or `k=0`) are initialized to 0, representing an LCS of length 0 for empty prefixes.

6. **LCS Logic:**
   - We iterate through the DP table using nested loops for `i` (str1), `j` (str2), and `k` (str3), starting from 1 (excluding empty subsequences).
   - At each cell `dp[i][j][k]`, we check if the characters at the corresponding indices in all three strings are equal.
     - If they are equal, it means the characters can be part of the LCS. In this case, the LCS length at this cell is calculated as `dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - 1] + 1`, where 1 is added for the current character.
     - If the characters are not equal, the LCS length at this cell is the maximum of the LCS lengths from the following three cases:
        - Considering only `str1` and `str2` (excluding `str3[k-1]`).
        - Considering only `str2` and `str3` (excluding `str1[i-1]`).
        - Considering only `str1` and `str3` (excluding `str2[j-1]`).

   This logic ensures that we only consider characters that can contribute to the LCS while maximizing the length based on previous calculations.

7. **Final LCS Length:**
   - After iterating through the entire DP table, the length of the LCS for the three strings is stored in the bottom right corner cell `dp[m - 1][n - 1][p - 1]`. This is because this cell represents the LCS considering all prefixes of the three strings.

8. **Example Usage:**
   - The code includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to call the `lcs_three_strings` function with three sample strings.
   - It then prints the calculated length of the LCS for these strings.

**Additional Notes:**

- This code utilizes dynamic programming, a technique that breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and stores solutions to these subproblems efficiently to avoid redundant calculations.
- The 3D DP table allows us to consider all possible combinations of prefixes from the three strings, leading to the optimal LCS length.

I hope this comprehensive explanation clarifies the entire code and its functionality. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

You're right! The time and space complexity of the LCS of three strings using dynamic programming is indeed O(m * n * p), where:

- m is the length of the first string.
- n is the length of the second string.
- p is the length of the third string.

**Breakdown:**

- **Space Complexity (O(m * n * p)):**
  - The code creates a 3D DP table `dp` with dimensions (m x n x p) to store LCS lengths for all possible combinations of prefixes from the three strings. This table dominates the space complexity as it stores intermediate results for efficient computation.

- **Time Complexity (O(m * n * p)):**
  - The nested loops iterate through the DP table, considering each cell (m * n * p cells in total).
  - Within each cell, calculations are performed to determine the LCS length based on previous subproblems (constant time operations).

  Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the number of cells visited in the DP table, resulting in O(m * n * p).

**In essence:**

- The space complexity is O(m * n * p) due to the DP table size.
- The time complexity is also O(m * n * p) because the algorithm iterates through the entire DP table.
