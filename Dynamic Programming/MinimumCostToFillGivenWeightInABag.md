To solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to buy exactly `w` kg of oranges given the constraints, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The problem is similar to the "unbounded knapsack problem" where we need to determine the minimum cost to achieve a specific weight using available packet sizes.

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(w . n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(w)\)

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the DP array**:
   - Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to buy `i` kg of oranges.
   - Set `dp[0] = 0` because no cost is required to buy 0 kg.
   - Set all other `dp[i]` values to a large number (infinity) initially, since we are looking for the minimum cost.

2. **Fill the DP array**:
   - For each weight `i` from 1 to `w`, check all possible packets `j` (where 1 ≤ j ≤ n).
   - If a packet `j` is available (i.e., `cost[j] != -1`) and the current weight `i` is at least `j`, update `dp[i]` with the minimum cost by considering the current packet.
   - Specifically, update `dp[i]` using the formula: 
     ```
     dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j] + cost[j])
     ```

3. **Check the result**:
   - If `dp[w]` remains as infinity, it means it's impossible to buy exactly `w` kg of oranges, so return -1.
   - Otherwise, return `dp[w]` which contains the minimum cost to buy exactly `w` kg.

Here is the Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
def minimum_cost_to_buy_w_kg_oranges(cost, n, w):
    # Initialize dp array with infinity
    dp = [float('inf')] * (w + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Cost to buy 0 kg is 0

    # Fill dp array
    for i in range(1, w + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if j <= i and cost[j] != -1:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j] + cost[j])
    
    # If dp[w] is still infinity, it's impossible to buy exactly w kg
    return -1 if dp[w] == float('inf') else dp[w]

# Example usage
cost = [-1, 2, -1, 5, 6]  # Cost array with 1-based indexing
n = len(cost) - 1  # Because cost is 1-based, so the size is len(cost) - 1
w = 5  # The weight we want to buy

print(minimum_cost_to_buy_w_kg_oranges(cost, n, w))  # Output should be 4
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- The `cost` array is `[-1, 2, -1, 5, 6]`.
- `cost[1] = 2`: 1 kg packet costs 2 units.
- `cost[2] = -1`: 2 kg packet is unavailable.
- `cost[3] = 5`: 3 kg packet costs 5 units.
- `cost[4] = 6`: 4 kg packet costs 6 units.

To achieve `w = 5` kg:
- We can use five 1 kg packets costing `5 * 2 = 10`.
- Or we can use one 4 kg packet and one 1 kg packet costing `6 + 2 = 8`.

The minimum cost is `8`, so the function should return `8`.

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the provided dynamic programming solution.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm can be analyzed as follows:
- We iterate through all possible weights from 1 to `w`.
- For each weight `i`, we iterate through all packet sizes from 1 to `n`.

The nested loops give us a time complexity of \(O(w . n)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm is determined by the space used for the DP array `dp`:
- The `dp` array has a size of `w + 1`.

So the space complexity is \(O(w)\).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(w . n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(w)\)
