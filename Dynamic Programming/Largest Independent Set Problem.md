To solve the problem of finding the size of the Largest Independent Set (LIS) in a binary tree, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Below is a detailed explanation, including the algorithm, implementation, and analysis of time and space complexity.

### Explanation:

- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)

- Space Complexity: \(O(n)\)

#### Problem Definition:
- A subset of nodes in a binary tree is called an Independent Set if no two nodes in the subset are adjacent (i.e., there is no direct edge connecting any two nodes in the subset).
- The goal is to find the size of the Largest Independent Set (LIS) in the given binary tree.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. **Recursive Definition:**
   - Let `LIS(node)` represent the size of the Largest Independent Set in the subtree rooted at `node`.
   - For each node, we have two choices:
     1. Include the current node in the LIS.
     2. Exclude the current node from the LIS.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If the node is `NULL`, the size of LIS is 0.

3. **Recursive Case:**
   - If we include the current node:
     - We cannot include its immediate children.
     - Therefore, we include the current node and move to its grandchildren.
   - If we exclude the current node:
     - We can include its children.
   - The size of the LIS for the current node will be the maximum of the above two scenarios.

4. **Memoization:**
   - To avoid recomputation of LIS values for the same nodes, we use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

### Algorithm:

1. Define a function `LIS(node)` to compute the LIS size for the subtree rooted at `node`.
2. Use a dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems.
3. For each node, recursively calculate the LIS by considering both scenarios (including and excluding the node).
4. Return the maximum of the two scenarios.

### Implementation:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.data = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def LIS(root):
    # Dictionary to store results of subproblems
    dp = {}
    
    def LISUtil(node):
        if node is None:
            return 0
        
        if node in dp:
            return dp[node]
        
        # If we include this node, we cannot include its children
        include_node = 1
        if node.left:
            include_node += LISUtil(node.left.left) + LISUtil(node.left.right)
        if node.right:
            include_node += LISUtil(node.right.left) + LISUtil(node.right.right)
        
        # If we exclude this node, we can include its children
        exclude_node = LISUtil(node.left) + LISUtil(node.right)
        
        # Store the result in the dictionary and return
        dp[node] = max(include_node, exclude_node)
        return dp[node]
    
    return LISUtil(root)

# Example usage:
# Construct the tree
#        10
#       /  \
#      20  30
#     / \    \
#    40 50   60
#       / \ 
#      70 80

root = Node(10)
root.left = Node(20)
root.right = Node(30)
root.left.left = Node(40)
root.left.right = Node(50)
root.left.right.left = Node(70)
root.left.right.right = Node(80)
root.right.right = Node(60)

print("Size of the Largest Independent Set is:", LIS(root))
```

### Time Complexity:
- Each node is processed only once, and the results are stored in the dictionary `dp`.
- Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage used by the dictionary `dp` and the call stack during recursion (in the worst case, the height of the tree could be \(O(n)\) in a skewed tree).

### Summary:
By using dynamic programming with memoization, we efficiently compute the size of the Largest Independent Set in a binary tree with optimal time and space complexity.
