### Counting palindromic subsequences

- Time Complexity: \(O(N^2)\)

- Space Complexity: \(O(N^2)\)

To solve the problem of counting palindromic subsequences in a given string `str` of length `N`, we can use dynamic programming (DP). Let's break down the solution step-by-step, and analyze the time and space complexity.

### Explanation

#### Definitions
1. **Palindrome**: A string that reads the same forward and backward.
2. **Subsequence**: A sequence derived by deleting some or none of the characters from the string without changing the order of the remaining characters.

#### Problem
We need to find the number of palindromic subsequences in the string and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Approach
We use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` that stores the number of palindromic subsequences in the substring `str[i...j]`.

##### Steps:
1. **Initialize**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of size \(N * N\) initialized to 0.
   - Every single character is a palindrome, so initialize `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - Iterate over all possible substring lengths starting from 2 to `N`.
   - For each length `l`, iterate over all possible starting indices `i`.
   - Compute the ending index `j` as `i + l - 1`.
   - Update the DP table based on the following rules:
     - If `str[i] == str[j]`:
       ```python
       dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] + 1
       ```
       (Count all palindromic subsequences in `str[i+1...j]`, `str[i...j-1]`, and add the new palindrome formed by `str[i]` and `str[j]`).
     - If `str[i] != str[j]`:
       ```python
       dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i + 1][j - 1]
       ```
       (Count palindromic subsequences in `str[i+1...j]` and `str[i...j-1]` but subtract the overcounted palindromic subsequences in `str[i+1...j-1]`).

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Ensure that all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow and adhere to the problem constraints.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\) because we fill an \(N * N\) DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N^2)\) for storing the DP table.

### Implementation

Here's the Python code to implement the above approach:

```python
def count_palindromic_subsequences(s):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    N = len(s)
    
    # Create a 2D DP array
    dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
    
    # Every single character is a palindrome
    for i in range(N):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP array
    for length in range(2, N + 1):
        for i in range(N - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] + 1) % MOD
            else:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i + 1][j - 1]) % MOD
    
            # Ensure non-negative modulo result
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + MOD) % MOD
    
    return dp[0][N - 1]

# Example usage:
s = "abcb"
print(count_palindromic_subsequences(s))  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation of the Example
For the string `s = "abcb"`:
- Palindromic subsequences are: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"b"`, `"bcb"`, `"cbc"`.
- The function will count these subsequences correctly using the DP approach and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This method ensures an efficient and clear way to count all palindromic subsequences in a string.
