### Intersection Of Two Sorted Linked Lists

To solve the problem of finding the intersection of two sorted linked lists, we need to create a new linked list that represents the intersection of the two input linked lists without altering the original lists. The intersection of two linked lists will contain all the elements that appear in both lists.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m + n)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(min(m, n))\)

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a dummy node for the result linked list. This helps in easily handling the head of the new linked list.
   - Maintain a `current` pointer initialized to the dummy node, which will be used to build the result linked list.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Use two pointers, `head1` and `head2`, initialized to the heads of the two input linked lists.
   - Traverse both lists simultaneously, comparing the current nodes pointed by `head1` and `head2`.

3. **Comparison and Building the Result List**:
   - If the value of the node pointed by `head1` is equal to the value of the node pointed by `head2`, it means this value is part of the intersection:
     - Create a new node with this value.
     - Attach this new node to the `current` pointer of the result list.
     - Move both `head1` and `head2` to their respective next nodes.
     - Move the `current` pointer to the next node.
   - If the value of the node pointed by `head1` is less than the value of the node pointed by `head2`, move `head1` to the next node.
   - If the value of the node pointed by `head1` is greater than the value of the node pointed by `head2`, move `head2` to the next node.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when either `head1` or `head2` becomes `None`, meaning one of the lists has been fully traversed.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - The head of the new linked list representing the intersection will be the next node of the dummy node.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n)
  - Where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two linked lists. This is because we traverse each list at most once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(m, n))
  - In the worst case, the size of the intersection list can be as large as the smaller list.

### Python Implementation

Here's the Python implementation of the above logic:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def intersection(head1, head2):
    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node to help with the result linked list
    current = dummy  # Pointer to build the new list

    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val == head2.val:
            # Add this value to the result linked list
            current.next = ListNode(head1.val)
            current = current.next
            head1 = head1.next
            head2 = head2.next
        elif head1.val < head2.val:
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            head2 = head2.next

    return dummy.next

# Utility function to print a linked list
def print_linked_list(head):
    while head:
        print(head.val, end=" -> ")
        head = head.next
    print("None")

# Example usage
# List 1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6
# List 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8

# Creating the linked lists for the example
list1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(6)))))
list2 = ListNode(2, ListNode(4, ListNode(6, ListNode(8))))

# Finding the intersection
result = intersection(list1, list2)

# Printing the result
print_linked_list(result)  # Output: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> None
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **ListNode Class**:
   - This class represents a node in a linked list, with `val` as the value and `next` as the reference to the next node.

2. **intersection Function**:
   - Initializes a dummy node and a `current` pointer.
   - Traverses both input lists and builds the result list based on the comparisons.
   - Returns the head of the result list (next of the dummy node).

3. **print_linked_list Function**:
   - Utility function to print the linked list for verification purposes.

This implementation ensures that we correctly find and build the intersection of two sorted linked lists without modifying the original lists.
