Sorting a linked list using Quicksort involves several steps, including partitioning the list and recursively sorting the sublists. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation, a Python implementation, and an analysis of the time and space complexities.

### Quicksort for Linked Lists

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\)

#### Explanation

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sublists, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For a linked list, the key steps are:

1. **Partitioning the List:** 
   - Choose a pivot element (commonly the head of the list).
   - Reorder the list such that all nodes with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, and all nodes with values greater than the pivot come after it. The pivot node itself will be in its final position.
   
2. **Recursively Applying Quicksort:**
   - Recursively apply the above steps to the sublists formed by the nodes before and after the pivot.

#### Implementation

Here's how you can implement Quicksort for a singly linked list in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def get_tail(node):
    while node is not None and node.next is not None:
        node = node.next
    return node

def partition(head, end):
    if head == end or head is None or end is None:
        return head, end

    pivot_prev = head
    curr = head
    pivot = end
    tail = end

    while head != end:
        if head.value < pivot.value:
            pivot_prev = curr
            curr.value, head.value = head.value, curr.value
            curr = curr.next
        head = head.next

    curr.value, pivot.value = pivot.value, curr.value

    return pivot_prev, curr

def quicksort_rec(head, end):
    if head == end:
        return head

    pivot_prev, pivot = partition(head, end)
    
    if pivot_prev != pivot:
        temp = pivot_prev
        while temp.next != pivot:
            temp = temp.next
        temp.next = None

        head = quicksort_rec(head, temp)

        temp = get_tail(head)
        temp.next = pivot

    pivot.next = quicksort_rec(pivot.next, end)

    return head

def quicksort(head):
    end = get_tail(head)
    return quicksort_rec(head, end)

# Helper function to print the linked list
def print_list(head):
    while head is not None:
        print(head.value, end=" -> ")
        head = head.next
    print("None")

# Example Usage:
# Creating a linked list: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1
node1 = ListNode(3)
node2 = ListNode(5)
node3 = ListNode(8)
node4 = ListNode(5)
node5 = ListNode(10)
node6 = ListNode(2)
node7 = ListNode(1)
node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3
node3.next = node4
node4.next = node5
node5.next = node6
node6.next = node7

# Printing the original list
print("Original list:")
print_list(node1)

# Sorting the list using quicksort
sorted_head = quicksort(node1)

# Printing the sorted list
print("Sorted list:")
print_list(sorted_head)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case:** O(n log n) - This occurs when the pivot elements chosen always divide the list into two nearly equal halves.
- **Average Case:** O(n log n) - This occurs for a typical random distribution of elements.
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2) - This happens when the pivot elements result in highly unbalanced partitions (e.g., when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot).

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) - This is due to the recursion stack depth, which is O(log n) in the average case and can be O(n) in the worst case due to the nature of the recursive calls.

The provided implementation sorts a linked list using the Quicksort algorithm, maintaining the in-place nature of Quicksort and respecting the characteristics of linked lists.
