To solve the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists, we need to follow a structured approach. Here is a detailed explanation along with the code implementation, and the analysis of time and space complexity.

### Problem Explanation
Given two numbers represented by linked lists, we are required to add these two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. Each node in the linked list contains a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order, which means that the least significant digit comes first.

For example:
- Linked list for number 190: `1 -> 9 -> 0 -> null`
- Linked list for number 25: `2 -> 5 -> null`
- Sum: `190 + 25 = 215`
- Output linked list: `2 -> 1 -> 5 -> null`

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(max(n, m))\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(max(n, m))\)

### Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Initialization**: Create a dummy node to act as the head of the result linked list. Initialize pointers to traverse the given linked lists.
2. **Addition**: Traverse both linked lists and add corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition.
3. **Carry Handling**: If the sum of digits exceeds 9, compute the carry for the next addition.
4. **Node Creation**: Create a new node for each digit of the result and append it to the result linked list.
5. **Final Carry**: After traversal, if there is any carry left, add a new node for the carry.
6. **Return Result**: Return the next of the dummy node as it points to the actual result linked list.

### Code Implementation

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x=0, next=None):
        self.data = x
        self.next = next

def reverse_linked_list(self,head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

def addTwoLists(self, num1, num2):
    # code here
    # return head of sum list
    num1 = self.reverse_linked_list(num1)
    num2 = self.reverse_linked_list(num2)
    
    # Initialize a dummy node to help simplify the result list construction
    dummy = Node(0)
    current = dummy
    carry = 0
    
    # Traverse both linked lists
    while num1 or num2:
        # Get the values of the current nodes, if they exist
        x = num1.data if num1 else 0
        y = num2.data if num2 else 0
        
        # Calculate the sum and the new carry
        total = carry + x + y
        carry = total // 10
        
        # Create a new node for the digit and move the current pointer
        current.next = Node(total % 10)
        current = current.next
        
        # Move to the next nodes in the input lists
        if num1: num1 = num1.next
        if num2: num2 = num2.next
    
    # If there's any carry left, add a new node for it
    if carry > 0:
        current.next = Node(carry)
    
    new_head = self.reverse_linked_list(dummy.next)
    
    while new_head.data == 0 and new_head.next!=None:
        new_head = new_head.next
    
    # Return the head of the constructed list
    return new_head

# Helper function to print the linked list
def printLinkedList(node):
    while node:
        print(node.data, end=" -> ")
        node = node.next
    print("null")

# Example usage
# Creating linked list for number 190 -> 1 -> 9 -> 0 -> null
num1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(9, ListNode(0)))

# Creating linked list for number 25 -> 2 -> 5 -> null
num2 = ListNode(2, ListNode(5))

# Adding the two numbers
result = addTwoNumbers(num1, num2)

# Print the result linked list
printLinkedList(result)
```

### Explanation of Code
- **Class `ListNode`**: A class to define the structure of a linked list node.
- **Function `addTwoNumbers`**: 
  - It takes two linked lists `num1` and `num2` as input.
  - It initializes a dummy node to facilitate result construction.
  - It iterates through both linked lists, adding corresponding nodes and managing the carry.
  - After the iteration, it checks if there's any remaining carry and appends a node for it.
  - Finally, it returns the resultant linked list starting from the node next to the dummy node.
- **Helper function `printLinkedList`**: A utility to print the linked list for verification.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(max(n, m)), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the input linked lists. This is because we traverse both linked lists once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(max(n, m)), which is due to the space required for the result linked list. In the worst case, the length of the result list is one more than the longer input list (due to a carry).

This solution efficiently adds two numbers represented by linked lists and handles leading zeros, carry overs, and different lengths of input lists.
