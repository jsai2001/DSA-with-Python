### Preorder traversal of a binary tree

To solve the problem of performing a preorder traversal of a binary tree using both recursion and iteration, we'll first define the structure of the tree and then provide the solutions for both approaches. We'll also analyze their time and space complexities.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\log N)\)

### Tree Structure
A binary tree is made up of nodes where each node contains a value, a left child, and a right child.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### Preorder Traversal
In a preorder traversal, we visit nodes in the following order:
1. Visit the root node.
2. Recursively visit the left subtree.
3. Recursively visit the right subtree.

### Recursive Solution

#### Implementation
```python
def preorder_traversal_recursive(root):
    result = []
    
    def traverse(node):
        if node:
            result.append(node.value)  # Visit the root
            traverse(node.left)        # Traverse the left subtree
            traverse(node.right)       # Traverse the right subtree
    
    traverse(root)
    return result
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This space is used by the call stack during recursion. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), the height \(h\) could be \(n\), making the space complexity \(O(n)\). In the best case (a balanced tree), the height \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\), making the space complexity \(O(\log n)\).

### Iterative Solution

#### Implementation
We use a stack to simulate the call stack used in the recursive approach.

```python
def preorder_traversal_iterative(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    stack = [root]
    result = []
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.value)  # Visit the root
        
        # Push right child first so that left child is processed first
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
    
    return result
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), the height \(h\) could be \(n\), making the space complexity \(O(n)\). In the best case (a balanced tree), the height \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\), making the space complexity \(O(\log n)\). The space complexity here includes the space used by the stack.

### Summary
Both the recursive and iterative approaches have a time complexity of \(O(n)\). The space complexity is also \(O(h)\) for both approaches, where \(h\) is the height of the tree, but the recursive approach uses the call stack while the iterative approach uses an explicit stack.

Here's the complete code including the tree structure and both traversal methods:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def preorder_traversal_recursive(root):
    result = []
    
    def traverse(node):
        if node:
            result.append(node.value)  # Visit the root
            traverse(node.left)        # Traverse the left subtree
            traverse(node.right)       # Traverse the right subtree
    
    traverse(root)
    return result

def preorder_traversal_iterative(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    stack = [root]
    result = []
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.value)  # Visit the root
        
        # Push right child first so that left child is processed first
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
    
    return result
```

These methods allow you to perform a preorder traversal of a binary tree either recursively or iteratively, with clear documentation of their time and space complexities.
