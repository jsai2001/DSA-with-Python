### Diagonal traversal of a binary tree

Diagonal traversal of a binary tree is a way to traverse the tree such that all nodes lying between the same two parallel lines from the root are grouped together. In other words, nodes on the same diagonal are traversed together.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

## Approach
We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach with a dictionary to keep track of nodes that lie on the same diagonal. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Use a dictionary to map diagonal levels to nodes:** 
   - The key is the diagonal distance from the root.
   - The value is a list of nodes that fall on that diagonal.

2. **Perform a DFS traversal:**
   - For the root node, start with diagonal distance 0.
   - For the left child of a node, increase the diagonal distance by 1.
   - For the right child, the diagonal distance remains the same.

3. **Store nodes in the dictionary based on their diagonal distance.**

4. **Extract and print the values from the dictionary.**

### Algorithm
Here is the Python implementation:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.data = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def diagonal_traversal(root):
    def traverse(node, diagonal, diagonal_dict):
        if not node:
            return
        
        # Add the current node to the corresponding diagonal
        if diagonal not in diagonal_dict:
            diagonal_dict[diagonal] = []
        diagonal_dict[diagonal].append(node.data)
        
        # Traverse left child with diagonal incremented by 1
        traverse(node.left, diagonal + 1, diagonal_dict)
        
        # Traverse right child with the same diagonal
        traverse(node.right, diagonal, diagonal_dict)
    
    # Dictionary to hold the diagonal nodes
    diagonal_dict = {}
    
    # Traverse the tree
    traverse(root, 0, diagonal_dict)
    
    # Extracting and printing the diagonals
    result = []
    for diagonal in sorted(diagonal_dict.keys()):
        result.append(diagonal_dict[diagonal])
    
    return result

# Example Usage
# Construct the following binary tree
#            8
#         /     \
#        3       10
#      /   \       \
#     1     6       14
#         /   \    /
#        4     7  13

root = Node(8)
root.left = Node(3)
root.right = Node(10)
root.left.left = Node(1)
root.left.right = Node(6)
root.left.right.left = Node(4)
root.left.right.right = Node(7)
root.right.right = Node(14)
root.right.right.left = Node(13)

print(diagonal_traversal(root))
```

### Explanation

- **Node Class:** Defines the structure of a binary tree node.
- **diagonal_traversal Function:** Initializes the traversal and organizes nodes into diagonals using a dictionary.
- **traverse Function:** Recursively traverses the binary tree while populating the dictionary based on diagonal distances.
- **Example Usage:** Demonstrates the construction of a binary tree and how to call the diagonal traversal function.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once, and inserting nodes into the dictionary and lists takes constant time on average.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(N)\) as well, due to the dictionary storing all nodes. Additionally, the recursion stack will also take up space equivalent to the height of the tree, which in the worst case (skewed tree) can be \(O(N)\). Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(N)\).
