### Mirror of a tree

To solve the problem of creating a mirror tree from a given binary tree, we can follow a systematic approach. A mirror tree is a tree where the left and right children of all non-leaf nodes are swapped. Here's how to achieve this with clear documentation and details of time and space complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\log N)\)

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define the Tree Structure**:
   First, we need a definition for the binary tree nodes.

2. **Mirror Function**:
   Create a function that recursively swaps the left and right children of each node.

3. **Complexity Analysis**:
   Analyze the time and space complexity of the mirror function.

### Tree Node Definition

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### Mirror Function

```python
def mirror_tree(node):
    """
    Mirrors the given binary tree in place.
    
    :param node: The root node of the binary tree.
    :return: The root node of the mirrored binary tree.
    """
    if node is None:
        return None

    # Swap the left and right children
    node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left

    # Recursively mirror the left and right subtrees
    if node.left:
        mirror_tree(node.left)
    if node.right:
        mirror_tree(node.right)

    return node
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of this solution is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This space is used by the call stack during the recursive function calls. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, \(h\) can be \(n\), making the space complexity \(O(n)\). For a balanced tree, the height \(h\) is \(O(\log n)\), making the space complexity \(O(\log n)\).

### Example Usage

```python
def print_inorder(node):
    """
    Helper function to print the tree nodes in inorder traversal.
    
    :param node: The root node of the binary tree.
    """
    if node:
        print_inorder(node.left)
        print(node.value, end=' ')
        print_inorder(node.right)

# Example tree:
#        1
#       / \
#      2   3
#     / \
#    4   5

# Create the tree
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

print("Original tree inorder:")
print_inorder(root)

# Mirror the tree
mirror_tree(root)

print("\nMirrored tree inorder:")
print_inorder(root)

# Output should show the original inorder as 4 2 5 1 3
# and the mirrored inorder as 3 1 5 2 4
```

This code will create a binary tree, mirror it, and print the inorder traversal of both the original and mirrored trees. The mirror operation is achieved by recursively swapping the left and right children of each node, demonstrating the concept and ensuring correctness through traversal checks.
