### Left view of a binary tree

To solve the problem of finding the left view of a binary tree, we need to output the first node at each level when traversing the tree from left to right. This can be achieved using either breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). Here, I'll provide a solution using BFS.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

### Problem Definition

Given a binary tree, the left view of the tree is defined as the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the left side.

### Approach

We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level. For each level, we will add the first node (from left to right) to our result list.

### Steps

1. **Initialize a Queue:** Use a queue to help with level order traversal. Initialize the queue with the root node.
2. **Traverse Level by Level:** For each level, determine the number of nodes at that level.
3. **Track the First Node:** For each level, add the first node (the leftmost node) to the result list.
4. **Add Child Nodes to Queue:** Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue for the next level traversal.

### Algorithm

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def left_view(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    queue = [root]

    while queue:
        level_length = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_length):
            node = queue.pop(0)
            if i == 0:
                result.append(node.value)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

    return result
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is processed exactly once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this algorithm is \(O(w)\), where \(w\) is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case, the maximum width can be at the last level, which in a balanced tree is \(O(n/2)\) and thus \(O(n)\) in the worst case. 

### Example

Let's consider an example binary tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
```

The left view of this tree is `[1, 2, 4]`.

### Detailed Walkthrough

1. **Initialization:**
   - `queue = [1]`
   - `result = []`
2. **First Level:**
   - Level length is 1.
   - Process node 1:
     - Add 1 to the result (`result = [1]`).
     - Add left child 2 and right child 3 to the queue (`queue = [2, 3]`).
3. **Second Level:**
   - Level length is 2.
   - Process node 2:
     - Add 2 to the result (`result = [1, 2]`).
     - Add left child 4 and right child 5 to the queue (`queue = [3, 4, 5]`).
   - Process node 3:
     - Add right child 6 to the queue (`queue = [4, 5, 6]`).
4. **Third Level:**
   - Level length is 3.
   - Process node 4:
     - Add 4 to the result (`result = [1, 2, 4]`).
   - Process nodes 5 and 6 without adding anything to the result.

The final result, `[1, 2, 4]`, represents the left view of the tree.
