### Reverse Level Order Traversal

To solve the problem of finding the reverse level order traversal of a binary tree, we'll follow a systematic approach. Below is a detailed explanation, including the algorithm, code, and analysis of time and space complexity.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

### Explanation

**Reverse Level Order Traversal**: This means we traverse the binary tree from the bottom-most level to the top-most level, and within each level from left to right.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Use a Queue for Level Order Traversal**: A queue will help in performing a standard level order traversal (breadth-first search) by processing nodes level by level.
2. **Use a Stack to Reverse the Order**: By pushing the nodes onto a stack as they are visited, we can then pop them off in reverse order, which gives us the reverse level order traversal.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a queue and a stack.
2. Enqueue the root node to the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a node from the queue.
   - Push the dequeued node onto the stack.
   - Enqueue the right child of the dequeued node (if it exists).
   - Enqueue the left child of the dequeued node (if it exists).
4. After the queue is empty, pop all nodes from the stack to get them in reverse level order.

### Implementation

Here's the Python code to perform the reverse level order traversal of a binary tree:

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def reverse_level_order_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    queue = deque()
    stack = []

    queue.append(root)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        stack.append(node)

        # Enqueue right child first so that left child is processed first in stack
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)

    # Now stack contains the reverse level order traversal
    result = []
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.val)

    return result

# Example usage:
# Construct a binary tree
#       1
#      / \
#     2   3
#    /|   |\
#   4 5   6 7
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
root.right.left = TreeNode(6)
root.right.right = TreeNode(7)

# Get reverse level order traversal
print(reverse_level_order_traversal(root))  # Output: [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 1]
```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code

1. **TreeNode Class**: Defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **reverse_level_order_traversal Function**:
   - **Input**: The root node of the binary tree.
   - **Output**: A list of node values in reverse level order.
   - **Queue Initialization**: The `queue` is initialized with the root node to start the level order traversal.
   - **Stack Initialization**: The `stack` is used to store nodes in the order they are visited.
   - **Level Order Traversal**: Nodes are processed level by level. For each node, we enqueue its right child first and then its left child to ensure that nodes are pushed onto the stack in the correct order.
   - **Reverse Order Extraction**: Nodes are popped from the stack and added to the result list, giving the reverse level order.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
- Each node is visited exactly once during the traversal, making the time complexity linear in terms of the number of nodes \(n\).

**Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
- The queue and stack both store up to \(n\) nodes in the worst case, leading to linear space complexity.

This approach ensures that the reverse level order traversal is efficient and easy to understand.
