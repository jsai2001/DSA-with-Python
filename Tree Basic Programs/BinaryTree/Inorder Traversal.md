Implementation of inorder traversal of a binary tree using both recursion and iteration, along with clear documentation and analysis of time and space complexity.

### Inorder Traversal Using Recursion

In an inorder traversal, we visit the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. This can be implemented using a simple recursive function.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\log N)\)

#### Recursive Implementation

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def inorder_traversal_recursive(root):
    """
    Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree using recursion.
    
    :param root: TreeNode, the root of the binary tree
    :return: List[int], the inorder traversal of the tree's nodes' values
    """
    result = []
    
    def traverse(node):
        if not node:
            return
        traverse(node.left)
        result.append(node.value)
        traverse(node.right)
    
    traverse(root)
    return result

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(1, None, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(3)))
# print(inorder_traversal_recursive(root))  # Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.

#### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a completely unbalanced tree), \(h\) can be \(n\), and in the best case (for a balanced tree), \(h\) can be \(log(n)\).

### Inorder Traversal Using Iteration

In the iterative approach, we use a stack to simulate the recursion. We push nodes onto the stack as we traverse down the left subtree, and then we process the nodes in the stack as we backtrack.

#### Iterative Implementation

```python
def inorder_traversal_iterative(root):
    """
    Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree using iteration.
    
    :param root: TreeNode, the root of the binary tree
    :return: List[int], the inorder traversal of the tree's nodes' values
    """
    result = []
    stack = []
    current = root
    
    while current or stack:
        # Reach the leftmost node of the current node
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
        
        # Current must be None at this point
        current = stack.pop()
        result.append(current.value)
        
        # We have visited the node and its left subtree. Now, it's right subtree's turn
        current = current.right
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(1, None, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(3)))
# print(inorder_traversal_iterative(root))  # Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.

#### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. The stack will contain at most \(h\) nodes at any time. In the worst case (for a completely unbalanced tree), \(h\) can be \(n\), and in the best case (for a balanced tree), \(h\) can be \(log(n)\).

Both recursive and iterative approaches have the same time and space complexities, but they differ in their implementation details. The recursive method uses the call stack to manage traversal, while the iterative method uses an explicit stack.
