### Merge Two Balanced Binary Search Trees

Merging two balanced binary search trees (BSTs) into a single balanced BST can be accomplished in several steps. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide, including the time and space complexity analysis.

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

## Steps to Merge Two Balanced BSTs

1. **Inorder Traversal of Both Trees**:
   Perform an inorder traversal of both BSTs to get two sorted arrays. This step takes \(O(n)\) time for each tree, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**:
   Merge the two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. This step takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the total number of nodes in both trees.

3. **Construct a Balanced BST**:
   Construct a balanced BST from the merged sorted array. This step takes \(O(n)\) time.

### Detailed Implementation

Here's the Python code that demonstrates this process:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def inorder_traversal(root, result):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left, result)
        result.append(root.value)
        inorder_traversal(root.right, result)

def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    merged = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            merged.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    # Append remaining elements
    merged.extend(arr1[i:])
    merged.extend(arr2[j:])
    return merged

def sorted_array_to_bst(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    root = TreeNode(arr[mid])
    root.left = sorted_array_to_bst(arr[:mid])
    root.right = sorted_array_to_bst(arr[mid + 1:])
    return root

def merge_bsts(root1, root2):
    # Step 1: Perform inorder traversal of both BSTs to get sorted arrays
    arr1 = []
    inorder_traversal(root1, arr1)
    arr2 = []
    inorder_traversal(root2, arr2)
    
    # Step 2: Merge the two sorted arrays
    merged_array = merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the merged sorted array to a balanced BST
    return sorted_array_to_bst(merged_array)

# Example usage:
# Creating two balanced BSTs for demonstration
root1 = TreeNode(3)
root1.left = TreeNode(1)
root1.right = TreeNode(4)

root2 = TreeNode(6)
root2.left = TreeNode(5)
root2.right = TreeNode(7)

# Merging the BSTs
merged_root = merge_bsts(root1, root2)

# Function to print the inorder traversal of the merged BST
def print_inorder(root):
    if root:
        print_inorder(root.left)
        print(root.value, end=' ')
        print_inorder(root.right)

print("Inorder traversal of the merged BST:")
print_inorder(merged_root)
```

### Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   Defines a node in the BST.

2. **Inorder Traversal Function**:
   Performs an inorder traversal of the BST and appends the values to a list, ensuring the values are sorted.

3. **Merge Sorted Arrays Function**:
   Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

4. **Sorted Array to BST Function**:
   Converts a sorted array into a balanced BST using a recursive approach to ensure the tree remains balanced.

5. **Merge BSTs Function**:
   Combines all the steps: it performs inorder traversals on both BSTs, merges the resulting arrays, and constructs a balanced BST from the merged array.

### Time Complexity

- **Inorder Traversal**: \(O(n)\) for each tree, where \(n\) is the number of nodes.
- **Merge Sorted Arrays**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the total number of nodes in both trees.
- **Construct Balanced BST**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the total number of nodes.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Space Complexity

- **Inorder Traversal Arrays**: \(O(n)\) for each tree.
- **Merged Array**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the total number of nodes.
- **Recursion Stack for Constructing BST**: \(O(\log n)\) due to the depth of the balanced BST.

Overall, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).
